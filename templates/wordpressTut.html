                        </p>
                        <p>GNU makes sure that any software source-code licensed under it has to make
                            originating source code open and freely available to all its users. Here, freely
                            doesn't mean by cost but it means that it is freely available to users to
                            distribute and modify the code, but they can't impose any restrictions on
                            further distribution, source code has to be made available.</p>

                        <p>On 29th June 2007, the third version GNU GPLv3 (version 3) was released. It was
                            discovered to deal with some problems that were present in the second version.

                        <p>With the help of WordPress theme, you can design the layout and appearance of
                            your website in the front-end.</p>
                        <p>When WordPress is installed, it has a pre-installed theme which is very simple
                            and unattractive. But no one wants a website to be that much simple. To make it
                            more attractive one can install and apply different themes from WordPress.</p>
                        <p>Themes provide a style (including font styling), colors, page layouts, widget
                            positions, etc. You can change the theme of your site without changing the
                            content of the site. Themes provide a unique look to your site.</p>
    
                        <h2 class="h2">Types of WordPress theme</h2>

                            are paid. You can choose a theme according to your choice.</p>
                        <p><strong>Free</strong></p>
                        <p>WordPress provides many good looking themes absolutely free in the WordPress
                            theme directory. If you are using your site for a small audience or yourself, go
                            for free one. Because there are some chances that same theme is being used by
                            another site.</p>
                        <p><strong>Premium</strong></p>
                        <p>Premium themes may cost you starting from $1,000. Prize varies depending upon the
                            design and requirement of your site.</p>
                        <p>One advantage in premium themes is that they provide a reliable code base and
                            offer support. It gives you a more enhanced security.</p>
    
                        <h2 class="h2">How to make a WordPress theme</h2>
                        <p>Building a WordPress theme is somewhat technical work. To build a theme you
                            should have a little knowledge about the following development languages.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>HTML</li>
                            <li>CSS</li>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                            <li>PHP</li>
                            <li>Database</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You should know how to use a web server.</p>
    
                        <h2 class="h2">Selecting WordPress Theme</h2>
                        <p>WordPress theme should be selected very wisely, so that it perfectly fits on your
                            site. You can select any one either paid or free. It should be complemented to
                            your site.</p>
                        <p>Themes affect a website in a lot of way. Heavy themes which look great may slow
                            down your website and Google will degrade its ranking. If a theme is not coded
                            properly, it becomes difficult to add any plugin or change that theme.</p>
                        <p>Theme selection is very important as everything for your website depends upon
                            theme.</p>
                        <p>Given below are some of the points which may help the users to select a theme for
                            their website.</p>
                        <p><strong>Look for Simplicity</strong></p>
                        <p>Your website should look good, but for that you shouldn't compromise with your
                            site's functionality. Theme styling should not be complicated. Complexity will
                            make things difficult for your users. All you need is a good theme, so don't go
                            for an attractive one compromising your users.</p>
                        <p><strong>Responsive</strong></p>
                        <p>Your theme should be compatible with all type of screen sizes. A large number of
                            traffic generates from devices other than laptops and PCs. Google also gives
                            better ranking to the responsive sites. Lot of themes is by default responsive
                            but still there are some themes which are not responsive. So look for a theme
                            which is responsive to make your website accessible by all device users.</p>
                        <p><strong>Browser Support</strong></p>
                        <p>Make sure the theme you select is supported by all the browsers. Before selecting
                            it, test it on different browsers for mobiles as well as laptops like Chrome,
                            Internet Explorer, and Firefox.</p>
                        <p><strong>Plugin Support</strong></p>
                        <p>Plugins are very important for a WordPress site. They enhance the functionality
                            of your site. Make sure that your selected theme must support all the popular
                            plugins.</p>
                        <p><strong>Multilingual Support</strong></p>
                        <p>Your theme should support multilingual to support different languages for users.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Help Option</strong></p>
                        <p>Only some developers provide support option with free themes, not all. So, if you
                            messed up with your site then you may have to solve it on your own. So rather
                            than facing all these problems, you should better choose a theme which has a
                            good documentation and support help option.</p>
                        <p><strong>SEO Friendliness</strong></p>
                        <p>To increase your site performance on search engines, choose a theme which is SEO
                            friendly. Many theme developers will let you know whether their theme is SEO
                            friendly or not.</p>
                        <p><strong>Ratings and Reviews</strong></p>
                        <p>Before downloading a theme, have a look on its rating and reviews. A theme has
                            both good and bad reviews, but if there are more negative reviews then read it
                            carefully and consider it once again.</p>

                        <p>WordPress plugins are programs written in PHP scripting language that extends the
                            functionality or add some new features to our WordPress site. They provide
                            additional functions to an application.</p>
                        <p>Users can add some more functions in their site without any coding skills by
                            adding plugins. There are thousands of freely and commercially plugins
                            available. For each and every function there is a plugin available in the
                            WordPress.</p>
                        <p>You can also uninstall a plugin from your site.</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">How to choose a plugin</h2>
                        <p>It is difficult for the users to find out the best suited plugin for them,
                            especially for beginners. As plugins are open source hence every plugin is
                            maintained by different owners. Some of them may be a kind of busy or
                            inexperienced which lead to outdated version of plugin. According to your need
                            you may have to install more than one plugin, but that?s not a problem. You can
                            install more than one plugin.</p>
                        <p>Here we'll show a list which may help you to choose a right plugin.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Make a list of your requirements</strong></li>
                            <p>First of all, you need to know what you want in your site. Make a list of all
                                the features you want to implement in your site. Remember to make them in
                                descending order of your need, it will make decision making easier. It's not
                                necessary that you'll find all of it in one plugin. Feel free to install
                                more than one plugin.</p>
                            <li><strong>Search plugins</strong></li>

                            a flexible CMS. It can be used to create a blog, website, and mobile
                            applications. It is also used to create an online store using <a

                        <p>WordPress is one of the most popular content management system (CMS) solutions in
                            use. It is used by more than <strong>60</strong> million websites, including

                        </p>
                        <p>WordPress is developed by its founders, American developer <strong>Matt
                                Mullenweg</strong> and English developer <strong>Mike Little</strong>. It
                            was initially released on <strong>27 May 2003</strong>. This software is

                        <h2 class="h2">What is Blogger?</h2>
                        <p><A href="https://www.javatpoint.com/blog">Blogger</a> is a blog publishing
                            platform, which is started by <strong>Pyra Labs</strong> in
                            <strong>1999</strong>, and later <strong>Google</strong> acquired it in
                            <strong>2003</strong>. It has two parts, which are <strong>Blogger</strong> and
                            <strong>BlogSpot</strong>. Here Blogger is a free blog publishing platform, and
                            BlogSpot is a free service provider. Since Google owns it, most of Google's
                            features come as default with Blogger like Ad meaning, Analytics, and AdWords.
                            The advantage of Blogger is that the new blogger can select the options for the
                            blog. It is free and user-friendly and has many free templates to customize the
                            template according to the user requirements. Here, the user can easily update
                            their blog. There will be no blog downtime unless hackers attack. Blogger offers
                            the ability to add multimedia in posts without any storage space limitations. We
                            may access the blogger through Mobile apps, <a
                                href="https://www.javatpoint.com/sms-full-form">SMS</a>, and <a
                                href="https://www.javatpoint.com/e-mail">Email</a>. By default, Google hosts
                            blogs on the blogspot.com subdomain for free. If the user selects the premium
                            services option, it hosts several subdomains with all options.

                            <li>In WordPress, users must pay for domain names and add a domain name to the
                                blog. Whereas in Blogger, users must pay for the domain name, and it is free
                                to add to the blog.</li>
                            <li>In WordPress, it is not an easy task to monitor with the help of
                                <strong>Google AdSense</strong>, but we can do it via affiliate links in
                                free service. Whereas in Blogger, it's easy to track with the help of
                                <strong>Google AdSense</strong>.
                            </li>
                            <li>Blogger is free to use other than Google Drive storage. While WordPress has
                                plans like basic, business, premium, etc.</li>
                            <li>We can do self-hosting with a WordPress Script in WordPress. While
                                self-hosting is not possible in Blogger.</li>
                            <li>WordPress supports social media and sharing plugins like <strong>Facebook,
                                    LinkedIn, Twitter</strong>. Whereas, Blogger only supports
