                        <p>Python tutorial provides basic and advanced concepts of Python. Our Python tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.</p>
                        <p>Python is a simple, general purpose, high level, and object-oriented programming language.</p>
                        <p>Python is an interpreted scripting language also. <em>Guido Van Rossum</em> is known as the founder of Python programming.</p>
                        <p>Our Python tutorial includes all topics of Python Programming such as installation, control statements, <a href="python-strings">Strings</a>, <a href="python-lists">Lists</a>, <a href="python-tuples">Tuples</a>,
                            <a href="python-dictionary">Dictionary</a>, <a href="python-modules">Modules</a>, <a href="python-exception-handling">Exceptions</a>, Date and Time, File I/O, Programs, etc. There are also given Python interview questions to
                            help you better understand Python Programming.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">What is Python</h2>
                        <p><strong>Python</strong> is a general purpose, dynamic, <a href="classification-of-programming-languages">high-level</a>, and interpreted programming language. It supports Object Oriented programming approach to develop applications.
                            It is simple and easy to learn and provides lots of high-level data structures.</p>
                        <p>Python is <em>easy to learn</em> yet powerful and versatile scripting language, which makes it attractive for Application Development.</p>
                        <p>Python's syntax and <em>dynamic typing</em> with its interpreted nature make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development.</p>
                        <p>Python supports <em>multiple programming pattern</em>, including object-oriented, imperative, and functional or procedural programming styles.</p>
                        <p>Python is not intended to work in a particular area, such as web programming. That is why it is known as <em>multipurpose</em> programming language because it can be used with web, enterprise, 3D CAD, etc.</p>
                        <p>We don't need to use data types to declare variable because it is <em>dynamically typed</em> so we can write a=10 to assign an integer value in an integer variable.</p>
                        <p>Python makes the development and debugging <em>fast</em> because there is no compilation step included in Python development, and edit-test-debug cycle is very fast.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python 2 vs. Python 3 </h2>
                        <p>In most of the programming languages, whenever a new version releases, it supports the features and syntax of the existing version of the language, therefore, it is easier for the projects to switch in the newer version. However,
                            in the case of Python, the two versions Python 2 and Python 3 are very much different from each other. </p>
                        <p>A list of differences between Python 2 and Python 3 are given below:</p>
                        <ol class="points">
                            <li>Python 2 uses <strong>print</strong> as a statement and used as print "something" to print some string on the console. On the other hand, Python 3 uses <strong>print</strong> as a function and used as print("something") to
                                print something on the console.</li>
                            <li>Python 2 uses the function raw_input() to accept the user's input. It returns the string representing the value, which is typed by the user. To convert it into the integer, we need to use the int() function in Python. On the
                                other hand, Python 3 uses input() function which automatically interpreted the type of input entered by the user. However, we can cast this value to any type by using primitive functions (int(), str(), etc.). </li>
                            <li>In Python 2, the implicit string type is ASCII, whereas, in Python 3, the implicit string type is Unicode.</li>
                            <li>Python 3 doesn't contain the xrange() function of Python 2. The xrange() is the variant of range() function which returns a xrange object that works similar to Java iterator. The range() returns a list for example the function
                                range(0,3) contains 0, 1, 2. </li>
                            <li>There is also a small change made in Exception handling in Python 3. It defines a keyword <strong>as</strong> which is necessary to be used. We will discuss it in Exception handling section of Python programming tutorial.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <h2 class="h2">Python History</h2>
                        <p>Python was invented by <strong>Guido van Rossum</strong> in 1991 at CWI in Netherland. The idea of Python programming language has taken from the ABC programming language or we can say that ABC is a predecessor of Python language.
                        </p>
                        <p>There is also a fact behind the choosing name Python. Guido van Rossum was a fan of the popular BBC comedy show of that time, <strong>"Monty Python's Flying Circus"</strong>. So he decided to pick the name <strong>Python</strong>                            for his newly created programming language.</p>
                        <p>Python has the vast community across the world and releases its version within the short period.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Why learn Python?</h2>
                        <p>Python provides many useful features to the programmer. These features make it most popular and widely used language. We have listed below few-essential feature of Python.</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">Where is Python used?</h2>
                        <p>Python is a general-purpose, popular programming language and it is used in almost every technical field. The various areas of Python use are given below.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>Data Science</li>
                            <li>Date Mining</li>
                            <li>Desktop Applications</li>
                            <li>Console-based Applications</li>
                            <li>Mobile Applications</li>
                            <li>Software Development</li>
                            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                            <li>Web Applications</li>
                            <li>Enterprise Applications</li>
                            <li>3D CAD Applications</li>
                            <li>Machine Learning</li>
                            <li>Computer Vision or Image Processing Applications.</li>
                            <li>Speech Recognitions</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python Basic Syntax</h2>
                        <p>There is no use of curly braces or semicolon in Python programming language. It is English-like language. But Python uses the indentation to define a block of code. Indentation is nothing but adding whitespace before the statement
                            when it is needed. <strong>For example -</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
def func():
       statement 1
       statement 2
       &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
       &hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;
         statement N
</textarea></div>
                        <p>In the above example, the statements that are same level to right belong to the function. Generally, we can use four whitespaces to define indentation.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python First Program</h2>
                        <p>Unlike the other programming languages, Python provides the facility to execute the code using few lines. <strong>For example</strong> - Suppose we want to print the <strong>"Hello World"</strong> program in Java; it will take
                            three lines to print it.</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
public class HelloWorld {
 public static void main(String[] args){
// Prints "Hello, World" to the terminal window.
  System.out.println("Hello World");
 }
 }
</textarea></div>
                        <p>On the other hand, we can do this using one statement in Python.</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
print("Hello World")
</textarea></div>
                        <p>Both programs will print the same result, but it takes only one statement without using a semicolon or curly braces in Python.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python Popular Frameworks and Libraries</h2>
                        <p>Python has wide range of libraries and frameworks widely used in various fields such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, web applications, etc. We define some popular frameworks and libraries of Python as follows.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Web development (Server-side) -</strong> Django Flask, Pyramid, CherryPy</li>
                            <li><strong>GUIs based applications -</strong> Tk, PyGTK, PyQt, PyJs, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Machine Learning -</strong> TensorFlow, PyTorch, <strong>Scikit-learn</strong>, Matplotlib, Scipy, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Mathematics -</strong> Numpy, Pandas, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python print() Function</h2>
                        <p>The <strong>print()</strong> function displays the given object to the standard output device (screen) or to the text stream file.</p>
                        <p>Unlike the other programming languages, Python <strong>print()</strong> function is most unique and versatile function.</p>
                        <p>The syntax of <strong>print()</strong> function is given below.</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)
</textarea></div>
                        <p>Let's explain its parameters one by one.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>objects -</strong> An object is nothing but a statement that to be printed. The * sign represents that there can be multiple statements.</li>
                            <li><strong>sep -</strong> The <strong>sep</strong> parameter separates the print values. Default values is ' '.</li>
                            <li><strong>end -</strong> The <strong>end</strong> is printed at last in the statement.</li>
                            <li><strong>file -</strong> It must be an object with a write(string) method.</li>
                            <li><strong>flush -</strong> The stream or file is forcibly flushed if it is true. By default, its value is false.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Let's understand the following example.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Example - 1: Return a value</h3>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
print("Welcome to javaTpoint.")

a = 10
# Two objects are passed in print() function
print("a =", a)

b = a
# Three objects are passed in print function
print('a =', a, '= b')
</textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Welcome to javaTpoint.
a = 10
a = 10 = b
</pre></div>
                        <p>As we can see in the above output, the multiple objects can be printed in the single <strong>print()</strong> statement. We just need to use comma (,) to separate with each other.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Example - 2: Using sep and end argument</h3>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
a = 10
print("a =", a, sep='dddd', end='\n\n\n')
print("a =", a, sep='0', end='$$$$$')
</textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock3"><pre>
a =dddd10


a =010$$$$$
</pre></div>
                        <p>In the first <strong>print()</strong> statement, we use the <strong>sep</strong> and <strong>end</strong> arguments. The given object is printed just after the <strong>sep</strong> values. The value of end parameter printed at
                            the last of given object. As we can see that, the second <strong>print()</strong> function printed the result after the three black lines.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Taking Input to the User</h2>
                        <p>Python provides the <strong>input()</strong> function which is used to take input from the user. Let's understand the following example.</p>
                        <p><strong>Example -</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
name = input("Enter a name of student:")
print("The student name is: ", name)
</textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Enter a name of student: Devansh
The student name is:   Devansh
</pre></div>
                        <p>By default, the <strong>input()</strong> function takes the string input but what if we want to take other data types as an input.</p>
                        <p>If we want to take input as an integer number, we need to typecast the <strong>input()</strong> function into an integer.</p>
                        <p><strong>For example -</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>Example -</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
a  = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))

print(a+b)
</textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock3"><pre>
Enter first number: 50
Enter second number: 100
150
</pre></div>
                        <p>We can take any type of values using <strong>input()</strong> function.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python Operators</h2>
                        <p>Operators are the symbols which perform various operations on Python objects. Python operators are the most essential to work with the Python data types. In addition, Python also provides identify membership and bitwise operators.
                            We will learn all these operators with the suitable example in following tutorial.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Python Operators</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python Conditional Statements</h2>
                        <p>Conditional statements help us to execute a particular block for a particular condition. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the conditional expression to execute a different block of statements. Python provides if and else
                            keywords to set up logical conditions. The elif keyword is also used as conditional statement.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Python if..else statement</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python Loops</h2>
                        <p>Sometimes we may need to alter the flow of the program. The execution of a specific code may need to be repeated several numbers of times. For this purpose, the programming languages provide various types of loops capable of repeating
                            some specific code several times. Consider the following tutorial to understand the statements in detail.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Python Loops</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Python For Loop</strong></li>
                            <li><strong>Python While Loop</strong></li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Python Data Structures</h2>
                        <p>Data structures are referred which can hold some data together or we say that they are used to store the data in organized way. Python provides built-in data structures such as <strong>list, tuple, dictionary, and set</strong>.
                            We can perform complex tasks using data structures.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Python List</h3>
                        <p>Python list holds the ordered collection of items. We can store a sequence of items in a list. Python list is mutable which means it can be modified after its creation. The items of lists are enclosed within the square bracket
                            [] and separated by the comma. Let's see the example of list.</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
L1 = ["John", 102, "USA"]    
L2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]   
</textarea></div>
                        <p>If we try to print the type of L1, L2, and L3 using <strong>type()</strong> function then it will come out to be a list.</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
print(type(L1))

                        <p>Python Tuple is used to store the sequence of immutable Python objects. The tuple is similar to lists since the value of the items stored in the list can be changed, whereas the tuple is immutable, and the value of the items stored
                            in the tuple cannot be changed.</p>
                        <p>Tuple can be defined as follows</p>
                        <p><strong>Example -</strong></p>

                        <p>Python Dictionary is a most efficient data structure and used to store the large amount of data. It stores the data in the key-value pair format. Each value is stored corresponding to its key.</p>
                        <p>Keys must be a unique and value can be any type such as integer, list, tuple, etc.</p>
                        <p>It is a mutable type; we can reassign after its creation. Below is the example of creating dictionary in Python.</p>

                        <p>Python modules are the program files that contain a Python code or functions. There are two types of module in the Python - User-define modules and built-in modules. A module that the user defines, or we can say that our Python
                            code saved with <strong>.py</strong> extension, is treated as a user-define module.</p>
                        <p>Built-in modules are predefined modules of Python. To use the functionality of the modules, we need to import them into our current working program.</p>

                            <li><strong>Classes and Objects -</strong> Python classes are the blueprint of the object. An object is a collection of data and method that act on the data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Inheritance -</strong> An inheritance is a technique where one class inherits the properties of other classes.</li>
                            <li><strong>Constructor -</strong> Python provides a special method <strong>__init__()</strong> which is known as a constructor. This method is automatically called when an object is instantiated.</li>
                            <li><strong>Data Member -</strong> A variable that holds data associated with a class and its objects.</li>

                            straightforward and much the same as the English language. There is no use of
                            the semicolon or curly-bracket, the indentation defines the code block. It is
                            the recommended programming language for beginners. </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">2) Expressive Language</h3>
                        <p>Python can perform complex tasks using a few lines of code. A simple example, the
                            hello world program you simply type <strong>print("Hello World")</strong>. It
                            will take only one line to execute, while Java or C takes multiple lines.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">3) Interpreted Language</h3>
                        <p>Python is an interpreted language; it means the Python program is executed one
                            line at a time. The advantage of being interpreted language, it makes debugging
                            easy and portable. </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">4) Cross-platform Language</h3>
                        <p>Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, UNIX, and
                            Macintosh, etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language. It enables
                            programmers to develop the software for several competing platforms by writing a
                            program only once. </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">5) Free and Open Source</h3>
                        <p>Python is freely available for everyone. It is freely available on its official
                            website <a href="https://www.python.org/" rel="nofollow" target="blank">www.python.org</a>. It
                            has a large community across the world
                            that is dedicatedly working towards make new python modules and functions.
                            Anyone can contribute to the Python community. The open-source means, "Anyone
                            can download its source code without paying any penny."</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">6) Object-Oriented Language</h3>
                        <p>Python supports object-oriented language and concepts of classes and objects come
                            into existence. It supports inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, etc.
                            The object-oriented procedure helps to programmer to write reusable code and
                            develop applications in less code. </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">7) Extensible</h3>
                        <p>It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and
                            thus it can be used further in our Python code. It converts the program into
                            byte code, and any platform can use that byte code. </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">8) Large Standard Library</h3>
                        <p>It provides a vast range of libraries for the various fields such as machine
                            learning, web developer, and also for the scripting. There are various machine
                            learning libraries, such as Tensor flow, Pandas, Numpy, Keras, and Pytorch, etc.
                            Django, flask, pyramids are the popular framework for Python web development.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">9) GUI Programming Support</h3>
                        <p>Graphical User Interface is used for the developing Desktop application. PyQT5,
                            Tkinter, Kivy are the libraries which are used for developing the web
                            application.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">10) Integrated</h3>
                        <p>It can be easily integrated with languages like C, C++, and JAVA, etc. Python
                            runs code line by line like C,C++ Java. It makes easy to debug the code.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">11. Embeddable</h3>
                        <p>The code of the other programming language can use in the Python source code. We
                            can use Python source code in another programming language as well. It can embed
                            other language into our code.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">12. Dynamic Memory Allocation</h3>
                        <p>In Python, we don't need to specify the data-type of the variable. When we assign
                            some value to the variable, it automatically allocates the memory to the
                            variable at run time. Suppose we are assigned integer value 15 to
                            <strong>x,</strong> then we don't need to write <strong>int x = 15.</strong>
                            Just write x = 15.
                        </p>

                            <li>Python laid its foundation in the late 1980s.</li>
                            <li>The implementation of Python was started in December 1989 by <strong>Guido
                                    Van Rossum</strong> at CWI in Netherland.</li>
                            <li>In February 1991, <strong>Guido Van Rossum</strong> published the code
                                (labeled version 0.9.0) to alt.sources.</li>
                            <li>In 1994, Python 1.0 was released with new features like lambda, map, filter,
                                and reduce.</li>
                            <li>Python 2.0 added new features such as list comprehensions, garbage
                                collection systems.</li>
                            <li>On December 3, 2008, Python 3.0 (also called "Py3K") was released. It was
                                designed to rectify the fundamental flaw of the language.</li>
                            <li><em>ABC programming language</em> is said to be the predecessor of Python
                                language, which was capable of Exception Handling and interfacing with the
                                Amoeba Operating System.</li>
                            <li>The following programming languages influence Python:
                                <ul class="points">
                                    <li>ABC language.</li>
                                    <li>Modula-3</li>

                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Why the Name Python?</h2>
                        <p>There is a fact behind choosing the name <a
                                href="https://www.javatpoint.com/python-tutorial">Python</a>. <strong>Guido
                                van Rossum</strong> was reading the script of a popular BBC comedy series
                            "<strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus</strong>". It was late on-air 1970s.</p>
                        <p>Van Rossum wanted to select a name which unique, sort, and little-bit mysterious.
                            So he decided to select naming Python after the <strong>"Monty Python's Flying
                                Circus"</strong> for their newly created programming language.</p>
                        <p>The comedy series was creative and well random. It talks about everything. Thus
                            it is slow and unpredictable, which made it very interesting.</p>
                        <p>Python is also versatile and widely used in every technical field, such as <a

                        <p>The goal should be clear before learning the Python. Python is an easy, a vast
                            language as well. It includes numbers of libraries, modules, in-built functions
                            and data structures. If the goal is unclear then it will be a boring and
                            monotonous journey of learning Python. Without any clear goal, you perhaps won't
                            make it done.</p>
                        <p>So, first figure out the motivation behind learning, which can anything be such
                            as knowing something new, develop projects using Python, switch to Python, etc.
                            Below are the general areas where Python is widely used. Pick any of them.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>Data Analysis and Processing</li>
                            <li>Artificial Intelligence</li>
                            <li>Games</li>
                            <li>Hardware/Sensor/Robots</li>
                            <li>Desktop Applications</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Choose any one or two areas according to your interest and start the journey
                            towards learning Python.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">2. Learn the Basic Syntax</h3>
                        <p>It is the most essential and basic step to learn the syntax of the Python
                            programming language. We have to learn the basic syntax before dive deeper into
                            learning it. As we have discussed in our earlier tutorial, Python is easy to
                            learn and has a simple syntax. It doesn't use semicolon and brackets. Its syntax
                            is like the English language.</p>
                        <p>So it will take minimum amount of time to learning its syntax. Once we get its
                            syntax properly, further learning will be easier and quicker getting to work on
                            projects.</p>
                        <h4 class="n">Note - Learn Python 3, not Python 2.7, because the industry no longer
                            uses it. Our Python tutorial is based on its latest version Python 3.</h4>
                        <h3 class="h3">3. Write Code by Own</h3>
                        <p>Writing the code is the most effective and robust way to learn Python. First, try
                            to write code on paper and run in mind (Dry Run) then move to the system.
                            Writing code on paper will help us get familiar quickly with the syntax and the
                            concept store in the deep memory. While writing the code, try to use proper
                            functions and suitable variables names.</p>
                        <p>There are many editors available for Python programming which highlights the
                            syntax related issue automatically. So we don't need to pay lot of attention of
                            these mistakes.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">4. Keep Practicing</h3>
                        <p>The next important step is to do the practice. It needs to implementing the
                            Python concepts through the code. We should be consistence to our daily coding
                            practice.</p>
                        <p>Consistency is the key of success in any aspect of life not only in programming.
                            Writing code daily will help to develop muscle memory.</p>
                        <p>We can do the problem exercise of related concepts or solve at least 2 or 3
                            problems of Python. It may seem hard but muscle memory plays large part in
                            programing. It will take us ahead from those who believe only the reading
                            concept of Python is sufficient.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">5. Make Notes as Needed</h3>
                        <p>Creating notes by own is an excellent method to learn the concepts and syntax of
                            Python. It will establish stability and focus that helps you become a Python
                            developer. Make brief and concise notes with relevant information and include
                            appropriate examples of the subject concerned.</p>
                        <p>Maintain own notes are also helped to learn fast. A study published in
                            Psychological Science that -</p>
                        <blockquote>The students who were taking longhand notes in the studies were forced
                            to be more selective &mdash; because you can't write as fast as you can type.
                        </blockquote>
                        <h3 class="h3">6. Discuss Concepts with Other</h3>
                        <p>Coding seems to be solitary activity, but we can enhance our skills by
                            interacting with the others. We should discuss our doubts to the expert or
                            friends who are learning Python. This habit will help to get additional
                            information, tips and tricks, and solution of coding problems. One of the best
                            advantages of Python, it has a great community. Therefore, we can also learn
                            from passionate Python enthusiasts.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">7. Do small Projects</h3>
                        <p>After understanding Python's basic concept, a beginner should try to work on
                            small projects. It will help to understand Python more deeply and become more
                            component in it. Theoretical knowledge is not enough to get command over the
                            Python language. These projects can be anything as long as they teach you
                            something. You can start with the small projects such as calculator app, a
                            tic-toc-toe game, an alarm clock app, a to-do list, student or customer
                            management system, etc.</p>
                        <p>Once you get handy with a small project, you can easily shift toward your
                            interesting domain (Machine Learning, Web Development, etc.).</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">8. Teach Others</h3>
                        <p>There is a famous saying that <strong>"If you want to learn something then you
                                should teach other"</strong>. It is also true in case of learning Python.
                            Share your information to other students via creating blog posts, recording
                            videos or taking classes in local training center. It will help us to enhance
                            the understanding of Python and explore the unseen loopholes in your knowledge.
                            If you don't want to do all these, join the online forum and post your answers
                            on Python related questions.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">9. Explore Libraries and Frameworks</h3>
                        <p>Python consists of vast libraries and various frameworks. After getting familiar
                            with Python's basic concepts, the next step is to explore the Python libraries.
                            Libraries are essential to work with the domain specific projects. In the
                            following section, we describe the brief introduction of the main libraries.</p>

                        <h3 class="h3">1) Web Applications</h3>
                        <p> We can use Python to develop web applications. It provides libraries to handle
                            internet protocols such as HTML and XML, JSON, Email processing, request,
                            beautifulSoup, Feedparser, etc. One of Python web-framework named Django is used
                            on <strong>Instagram</strong>. Python provides many useful frameworks, and these
                            are given below:</p>
                        <ul class="points">

                            <li>Flask and Bottle (Micro-framework)</li>
                            <li>Plone and Django CMS (Advance Content management)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="h3">2) Desktop GUI Applications</h3>
                        <p>The GUI stands for the Graphical User Interface, which provides a smooth
                            interaction to any application. Python provides a <strong>Tk GUI
                                library</strong> to develop a user interface. Some popular GUI libraries are
                            given below.</p>
                        <ul class="points">

                            <li>PyQt or Pyside</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="h3">3) Console-based Application</h3>
                        <p>Console-based applications run from the command-line or shell. These applications
                            are computer program which are used commands to execute. This kind of
                            application was more popular in the old generation of computers. Python can
                            develop this kind of application very effectively. It is famous for having REPL,
                            which means <strong>the Read-Eval-Print Loop</strong> that makes it the most
                            suitable language for the command-line applications.</p>
                        <p>Python provides many free library or module which helps to build the command-line
                            apps. The necessary <strong>IO</strong> libraries are used to read and write. It
                            helps to parse argument and create console help text out-of-the-box. There are
                            also advance libraries that can develop independent console apps.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">4) Software Development</h3>
                        <p>Python is useful for the software development process. It works as a support
                            language and can be used to build control and management, testing, etc.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>SCons</strong> is used to build control.</li>
                            <li><strong>Buildbot</strong> and <strong>Apache</strong> Gumps are used for
                                automated continuous compilation and testing.
