                        <h2 class="h2">What is Artificial Intelligence?</h2>
                        <p>In today's world, technology is growing very fast, and we are getting in touch
                            with different new technologies day by day.</p>
                        <p>Here, one of the booming technologies of computer science is Artificial
                            Intelligence which is ready to create a new revolution in the world by making
                            intelligent machines.The Artificial Intelligence is now all around us. It is
                            currently working with a variety of subfields, ranging from general to specific,
                            such as self-driving cars, playing chess, proving theorems, playing music,
                            Painting, etc.</p>
                        <p>AI is one of the fascinating and universal fields of Computer science which has a
                            great scope in future. AI holds a tendency to cause a machine to work as a
                            human.</p>

                            alt="Introduction to AI" />
                        <br>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence is composed of two words <strong>Artificial</strong> and
                            <strong>Intelligence</strong>, where Artificial defines <em>"man-made,"</em> and
                            intelligence defines <em>"thinking power"</em>, hence AI means <em>"a man-made
                                thinking power."</em>
                        </p>
                        <p>So, we can define AI as:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            "It is a branch of computer science by which we can create intelligent machines
                            which can behave like a human, think like humans, and able to make decisions."
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence exists when a machine can have human based skills such as
                            learning, reasoning, and solving problems</p>
                        <p>With Artificial Intelligence you do not need to preprogram a machine to do some
                            work, despite that you can create a machine with programmed algorithms which can
                            work with own intelligence, and that is the awesomeness of AI.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that AI is not a new technology, and some people says that as per
                            Greek myth, there were Mechanical men in early days which can work and behave
                            like humans.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Why Artificial Intelligence?</h2>

                        <p>In 1950, Alan Turing introduced a test to check whether a machine can think like
                            a human or not, this test is known as the Turing Test. In this test, Turing
                            proposed that the computer can be said to be an intelligent if it can mimic
                            human response under specific conditions.</p>
                        <p>Turing Test was introduced by Turing in his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and
                            Intelligence," which considered the question, "Can Machine think?"</p>

                            would not depend on the machine's ability to convert words as speech.</p>
                        <p>The test result does not depend on each correct answer, but only how closely its
                            responses like a human answer. The computer is permitted to do everything
                            possible to force a wrong identification by the interrogator.</p>
                        <p>The questions and answers can be like:</p>
                        <p><strong>Interrogator:</strong> Are you a computer?</p>
                        <p><strong>PlayerA (Computer):</strong> No</p>

                        <p><strong>Player A:</strong> Long pause and give the wrong answer.</p>
                        <p>In this game, if an interrogator would not be able to identify which is a machine
                            and which is human, then the computer passes the test successfully, and the
                            machine is said to be intelligent and can think like a human.</p>

                            offering a $100,000 prize for the first computer to pass the Turing test.
                            However, no AI program to till date, come close to passing an undiluted Turing

                        <p><strong>ELIZA:</strong> ELIZA was a Natural language processing computer program
                            created by Joseph Weizenbaum. It was created to demonstrate the ability of
                            communication between machine and humans. It was one of the first chatterbots,
                            which has attempted the Turing Test.</p>
                        <p><strong>Parry:</strong> Parry was a chatterbot created by Kenneth Colby in 1972.
                            Parry was designed to simulate a person with <strong>Paranoid
                                schizophrenia</strong>(most common chronic mental disorder). Parry was
                            described as "ELIZA with attitude." Parry was tested using a variation of the
                            Turing Test in the early 1970s.</p>
                        <p><strong>Eugene Goostman:</strong> Eugene Goostman was a chatbot developed in
                            Saint Petersburg in 2001. This bot has competed in the various number of Turing
                            Test. In June 2012, at an event, Goostman won the competition promoted as
                            largest-ever Turing test content, in which it has convinced 29% of judges that

                        <p>There were many philosophers who really disagreed with the complete concept of
                            Artificial Intelligence. The most famous argument in this list was
                            "<strong>Chinese Room</strong>."</p>
                        <p>In the year <strong>1980, John Searle</strong> presented "<strong>Chinese
                                Room</strong>" thought experiment, in his paper "<strong>Mind, Brains, and
                                Program</strong>," which was against the validity of Turing's Test.
                            According to his argument, "<strong>Programming a computer may make it to
                                understand a language, but it will not produce a real understanding of
                                language or consciousness in a computer</strong>."</p>
                        <p>He argued that Machine such as ELIZA and Parry could easily pass the Turing test
                            by manipulating keywords and symbol, but they had no real understanding of
                            language. So it cannot be described as "thinking" capability of a machine such
                            as a human.</p>

                        <p>In Artificial Intelligence, Search techniques are universal problem-solving
                            methods. <strong>Rational agents</strong> or <strong>Problem-solving
                                agents</strong> in AI mostly used these search strategies or algorithms to
                            solve a specific problem and provide the best result. Problem-solving agents are
                            the goal-based agents and use atomic representation. In this topic, we will
                            learn various problem-solving search algorithms. </p>

                            <li><strong>Search tree:</strong> A tree representation of search problem is
                                called Search tree. The root of the search tree is the root node which is
                                corresponding to the initial state.</li>
                            <li><strong>Actions:</strong> It gives the description of all the available

                        <p>Following are the four essential properties of search algorithms to compare the
                            efficiency of these algorithms:</p>
                        <p><strong>Completeness:</strong> A search algorithm is said to be complete if it
                            guarantees to return a solution if at least any solution exists for any random
                            input.</p>
                        <p><strong>Optimality:</strong> If a solution found for an algorithm is guaranteed
                            to be the best solution (lowest path cost) among all other solutions, then such
                            a solution for is said to be an optimal solution.</p>
                        <p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> Time complexity is a measure of time for an
                            algorithm to complete its task.</p>
                        <p><strong>Space Complexity:</strong> It is the maximum storage space required at
                            any point during the search, as the complexity of the problem.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Types of search algorithms</h2>
                        <p><strong>Based on the search problems we can classify the search algorithms into
                                uninformed (Blind search) search and informed search (Heuristic search)
                                algorithms. </strong></p>

                            alt="Search Algorithms in Artificial Intelligence" />
                        <h3 class="h3">Uninformed/Blind Search:</h3>
                        <p>The uninformed search does not contain any domain knowledge such as closeness,
                            the location of the goal. It operates in a brute-force way as it only includes
                            information about how to traverse the tree and how to identify leaf and goal
                            nodes. Uninformed search applies a way in which search tree is searched without
                            any information about the search space like initial state operators and test for
                            the goal, so it is also called blind search.It examines each node of the tree
                            until it achieves the goal node.</p>
                        <p><strong>It can be divided into five main types:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>Breadth-first search</li>
                            <li>Uniform cost search</li>
                            <li>Depth-first search</li>
                            <li>Iterative deepening depth-first search</li>
                            <li>Bidirectional Search</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="h3">Informed Search</h3>
                        <p>Informed search algorithms use domain knowledge. In an informed search, problem
                            information is available which can guide the search. Informed search strategies
                            can find a solution more efficiently than an uninformed search strategy.
                            Informed search is also called a Heuristic search.</p>
                        <p>A heuristic is a way which might not always be guaranteed for best solutions but
                            guaranteed to find a good solution in reasonable time.</p>
                        <p>Informed search can solve much complex problem which could not be solved in
                            another way.</p>
                        <p>An example of informed search algorithms is a traveling salesman problem.</p>

                        <p>Till now, we have learned knowledge representation using first-order logic and
                            propositional logic with certainty, which means we were sure about the
                            predicates. With this knowledge representation, we might write A&#8594;B, which
                            means if A is true then B is true, but consider a situation where we are not
                            sure about whether A is true or not then we cannot express this statement, this
                            situation is called uncertainty. </p>
                        <p>So to represent uncertain knowledge, where we are not sure about the predicates,
                            we need uncertain reasoning or probabilistic reasoning. </p>

                        <p>Following are some leading causes of uncertainty to occur in the real world.</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">Probabilistic reasoning:</h2>
                        <p>Probabilistic reasoning is a way of knowledge representation where we apply the
                            concept of probability to indicate the uncertainty in knowledge. In
                            probabilistic reasoning, we combine probability theory with logic to handle the
                            uncertainty.</p>
                        <p>We use probability in probabilistic reasoning because it provides a way to handle
                            the uncertainty that is the result of someone's laziness and ignorance. </p>
                        <p>In the real world, there are lots of scenarios, where the certainty of something
                            is not confirmed, such as "It will rain today," "behavior of someone for some
                            situations," "A match between two teams or two players." These are probable
                            sentences for which we can assume that it will happen but not sure about it, so
                            here we use probabilistic reasoning. </p>

                            <li>When there are unpredictable outcomes. </li>
                            <li>When specifications or possibilities of predicates becomes too large to
                                handle.</li>
                            <li>When an unknown error occurs during an experiment.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>In probabilistic reasoning, there are two ways to solve problems with uncertain
                            knowledge:</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Bayes' rule</strong></li>

                        <h4 class="n">Note: We will learn the above two rules in later chapters. </h4>
                        <p>As probabilistic reasoning uses probability and related terms, so before
                            understanding probabilistic reasoning, let's understand some common terms:</p>
                        <p><strong>Probability:</strong> Probability can be defined as a chance that an
                            uncertain event will occur. It is the numerical measure of the likelihood that
                            an event will occur. The value of probability always remains between 0 and 1
                            that represent ideal uncertainties.</p>

    P(A) =1, indicates total certainty in an event A.  
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>We can find the probability of an uncertain event by using the below formula.</p>

                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>P(&not;A) = probability of a not happening event. </li>
                            <li>P(&not;A) + P(A) = 1.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Event:</strong> Each possible outcome of a variable is called an event.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Sample space:</strong> The collection of all possible events is called
                            sample space. </p>
                        <p><strong>Random variables:</strong> Random variables are used to represent the
                            events and objects in the real world. </p>
                        <p><strong>Prior probability:</strong> The prior probability of an event is
                            probability computed before observing new information.</p>
                        <p><strong>Posterior Probability:</strong> The probability that is calculated after
                            all evidence or information has taken into account. It is a combination of prior
                            probability and new information. </p>
    
                        <h2 class="h3">Conditional probability:</h2>
                        <p>Conditional probability is a probability of occurring an event when another event
                            has already happened. </p>
                        <p>Let's suppose, we want to calculate the event A when event B has already
                            occurred, "the probability of A under the conditions of B", it can be written
                            as:</p>

                            alt="Probabilistic reasoning in Artificial intelligence" />
                        <p><strong>Where P(<em>A</em>&#8896;<em>B</em>)= Joint probability of a and
                                B</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>P(B)= Marginal probability of B. </strong>
                        <p>If the probability of A is given and we need to find the probability of B, then
                            it will be given as:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/probabilistic3.png"
                            alt="Probabilistic reasoning in Artificial intelligence" />
                        <p>It can be explained by using the below Venn diagram, where B is occurred event,
                            so sample space will be reduced to set B, and now we can only calculate event A
                            when event B is already occurred by dividing the probability of
                            <strong>P(A&#8896;<em>B</em>) by P( B )</strong>.

                        <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
                        <p>In a class, there are 70% of the students who like English and 40% of the
                            students who likes English and mathematics, and then what is the percent of
                            students those who like English also like mathematics?</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <p>Let, A is an event that a student likes Mathematics</p>
                        <p>B is an event that a student likes English. </p>

                        <p><strong>Hence, 57% are the students who like English also like Mathematics.

                            <strong>computer systems</strong>. It also includes <strong>Expert systems,
                                voice recognition, machine vision,</strong> and <strong>natural language
                                processing (NLP).</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p>AI programming focuses on three cognitive aspects, such as learning, reasoning,
                            and self-correction.</p>

                        </ol>
                        <p>Let's discuss the above examples in detail.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">1. Google Maps and Ride-Hailing Applications</h3>
                        <p>Travelling to a new destination does not require much thought any longer. Rather
                            than relying on confusing address directions, we can now easily open our phone's
                            map app and type in our destination.</p>
                        <p>So how does the app know about the appropriate directions, best way, and even the
                            presence of roadblocks and traffic jams? A few years ago, only <a
                                href="https://www.javatpoint.com/gps-full-form"><strong>GPS</strong></a>
                            (satellite-based navigation) was used as a navigation guide. However, artificial
                            intelligence (AI) now provides users with a much better experience in their
                            unique surroundings.</p>
                        <p>The app algorithm uses machine learning to recall the building's edges that are
                            supplied into the system after the person has manually acknowledged them. This
                            enables the map to provide simple visuals of buildings. Another feature is
                            identifying and understanding handwritten house numbers, which assists travelers
                            in finding the exact house they need. Their outline or handwritten label can
                            also recognize locations that lack formal street signs.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai1.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>The application has been trained to recognize and understand traffic. As a
                            result, it suggests the best way to avoid traffic congestion and bottlenecks.
                            The AI-based algorithm also informs users about the precise distance and time it
                            will take them to arrive at their destination. It has been trained to calculate
                            this based on the traffic situations. Several ride-hailing applications have
                            emerged as a result of the use of similar AI technology. So, whenever you need
                            to book a cab via an app by putting your location on a map, this is how it
                            works.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">2. Face Detection and Recognition</h3>
                        <p>Utilizing face ID for unlocking our phones and using virtual filters on our faces
                            while taking pictures are two uses of AI that are presently essential for our
                            day-by-day lives.</p>
                        <p>Face recognition is used in the former, which means that every human face can be
                            recognized. Face recognition is used in the above, which recognizes a particular
                            face.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai2.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
                        <p>Intelligent machines often match-and some cases, even exceed human performance! -
                            Human potential. Human babies begin to identifying facial features such as eyes,
                            lips, nose, and face shapes. A face, though, is more than just that. A number of
                            characteristics distinguish human faces. Smart machines are trained in order to
                            recognize facial coordinates (x, y, w, and h; which form a square around the
                            face as an area of interest), landmarks (nose, eyes, etc.), and alignment
                            (geometric structures). This improves the human ability to identify faces by
                            several factors. Face recognition is also used by government facilities or at
                            the airport for <strong>monitoring</strong>, and <strong>security</strong>.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">3. Text Editors or Autocorrect</h3>
                        <p>When typing a document, there are inbuilt or downloadable auto-correcting tools
                            for editors of spelling errors, readability, mistakes, and plagiarism based on
                            their difficulty level.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai3.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>It should have taken a long time for us to master our language and become fluent
                            in it. Artificially intelligent algorithms often used <strong>deep learning,
                                machine learning,</strong> and <strong>natural language</strong> in order to
                            detect inappropriate language use and recommend improvements. Linguists and
                            computer scientists collaborate in teaching machines grammar in the same way
                            that we learned it in school. Machines are fed large volumes of high-quality
                            data that has been structured in a way that machines can understand. Thus, when
                            we misspell a single comma, the editor will highlight it in red and offer
                            suggestions.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">4. Chatbots</h3>
                        <p>Answering a customer's inquiries can take a long time. The use of algorithms to
                            train machines to meet customer needs through chatbots is an artificially
                            intelligent solution to this problem. This allows machines to answer as well as
                            take and track orders.</p>

                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>We used Natural Language Processing (<strong>NLP</strong>) to train chatbots to
                            impersonate customer service agents' conversational approaches. Advanced
                            chatbots do not require complex input formats (such as yes/o questions). They
                            are capable of responding to complex questions that necessitate comprehensive
                            answers. They will appear to be a customer representative, in fact, another
                            example of artificial intelligence (AI). If you give a negative rating to a
                            response, the bot will figure out what went wrong and fix it the next time,
                            ensuring that you get the best possible service.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">5. Online-Payments</h3>
                        <p>It can be a time-consuming errand to rush to the bank for any transaction. Good
                            news! Artificial Intelligence is now being used by banks to support customers by
                            simplifying the process of payment.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai5.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>Artificial intelligence has enabled you to deposit checks from the convenience of
                            our own home. Since AI is capable of deciphering handwriting and making online
                            cheque processing practicable. Artificial Intelligence can potentially be
                            utilized to detect fraud by observing consumers' credit card spending patterns.
                            For example, the algorithms are aware of what items User X purchases, when and
                            where they are purchased, and in what price range they are purchased. If there
                            is some suspicious behaviour that does not match the user's profile, then the
                            system immediately signals user X.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">6. Search and Recommendation Algorithms</h3>
                        <p>When we wish to listen to our favorite songs or watch our favorite movie or shop
                            online, we have ever found that the things recommended to us perfectly match our
                            interests? This is the beauty of artificial intelligence.</p>
                        <p>These intelligent recommendation systems analyze our online activity and
                            preferences to provide us with similar content. Continuous training allows us to
                            have a customized experience. The data is obtained from the front-end, saved as
                            <strong>big data</strong>, and analysed using machine learning and deep
                            learning. Then it can predict your preferences and make suggestions to keep you
                            amused without having to look for something else. Artificial intelligence can
                            also be utilized to improve the user experience of a search engine. Generally,
                            the answer we are searching for is found in the top search results. What cause
                            this?
                        </p>

                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>Data is fed into a quality control algorithm to identify high-quality content
                            from <strong>SEO-spammed, low-quality content</strong>. This aids in creating an
                            ascending order of search results on the basis of the quality for the greatest
                            user experience. Since search engines are made up of codes, natural language
                            processing technology aids in understanding humans by these applications. In
                            reality, they can predict what a person wants to ask by compiling top-ranked
                            searches and guessing their questions when they begin to type.</p>
                        <p>Machines are constantly being updated with new features such as image search and
                            voice search. If we need to find out a song that is playing at a mall, all we
                            have to do is hold the phone up to it, and a music-identifying app will tell us
                            what it is within a few seconds. The machine will also offer you song details
                            after searching through an extensive collection of tunes.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">7. Digital Assistants</h3>
                        <p>When our hands are full, we often enlist the help of digital assistants to
                            complete tasks on our behalf. We might ask the assistant to call our father
                            while we are driving with a cup of tea in one hand. For instance, Siri would
                            look at our contacts, recognize the word "father," and dial the number.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai7.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>Siri is an example of a <strong>lower-tier model</strong> which can only respond
                            to voice commands and cannot deliver complex responses. The new digital
                            assistant is fluent in human language and uses advanced NLP (Natural Language
                            Processing) and ML (Machine Learning) techniques. They are capable of
                            understanding complex command inputs and providing acceptable results. They have
                            adaptive abilities which can examine <strong>preferences, habits,</strong> and
                            <strong>schedules</strong>. It enables them to use <strong>prompts,
                                schedules,</strong> and <strong>reminders</strong> to help us systemize,
                            coordinate, and plan things.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">8. Social Media</h3>
                        <p>The advent of social media gave the world a new narrative with immense freedom of
                            speech. Although, it brought certain social ills like cyberbullying, cybercrime,
                            and abuse of language. Several social media apps are using AI to help solve
                            these issues while also providing users with other enjoyable features.</p>
                        <p>AI algorithms are much quicker than humans at detecting and removing hate
                            speech-containing messages. It is made possible by their ability to recognize
                            hostile terms, keywords, and symbols in a variety of languages. These have been
                            entered into the system, which can also contribute neologisms to its dictionary.
                            Deep learning's neural network architecture is a vital part of the process.</p>
                        <p>Emojis have become the most common way to express a wide range of emotions. This
                            digital language is also understood by AI technology because it can understand
                            the meaning of a certain piece of text and guess the exact emoji.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai8.png"

                        <p>Social networking, a perfect example of artificial intelligence, may even figure
                            out what kind of content a user likes and recommends similar content. Facial
                            recognition is also used in social media profiles, assisting users in tagging
                            their friends via automatic suggestions. Smart filters can recognize spam and
                            undesirable messages and automatically filter them out. Users may also take
                            advantage of smart answers.</p>
                        <p>The social media sector could use artificial intelligence to detect mental health
                            issues such as suicidal thoughts by analyzing the information published and
                            consumed. This information can be shared with mental health professionals.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">9. Healthcare</h3>
                        <p><strong>Infervision</strong> is using artificial intelligence and deep learning
                            to save lives. In China, where there are insufficient radiologists to keep up
                            with the demand for checking 1.4 billion CT scans each year for early symptoms
                            of lung cancer. Radiologists essential to review many scans every day, which
                            isn't just dreary, yet human weariness can prompt errors. Infervision trained
                            and instructed algorithms to expand the work of radiologists in order to permit
                            them to diagnose cancer more proficiently and correctly.</p>

                        <p>The inspiration and foundation for Google's DeepMind are Neuroscience, which aims
                            to create a machine that can replicate the thinking processes in our own brains.
                            While DeepMind has effectively beaten people at games, what are truly
                            captivating are the opportunities for medical care applications. For example,
                            lessening the time it takes to plan treatments and utilizing machines to help
                            diagnose ailments.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">10. Gaming</h3>
                        <p>Artificial Intelligence has been an important part of the gaming industry in
                            recent years. In reality, one of AI's most significant achievements is in the
                            gaming industry.</p>
                        <p>One of the most important achievements in the field of AI is DeepMind's AI-based
                            AlphaGo software, which is famous for defeating Lee Sedol, the world champion in
                            the game of GO. Shortly after the win, DeepMind released
                            <strong>AlphaGo</strong>, which trounced its predecessor in an AI-AI face off.
                            The advanced machine, AlphaGo Zero, taught itself to master the game, unlike the
                            original AlphaGo, which DeepMind learned over time using a vast amount of data
                            and supervision.
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai10.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>Not at all like the first AlphaGo, which DeepMind prepared over the long run by
                            utilizing a lot of information and oversight, the high-level framework, AlphaGo
                            Zero instructed itself to dominate the game. Another example of Artificial
                            Intelligence in gaming comprises the First Encounter Assault Recon, also known
                            as F.E.A.R that is the first-person shooter video game.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">11. Online Ads Network</h3>
                        <p>The online advertising industry is the most significant user of artificial
                            intelligence that uses AI (<strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>) to not only
                            monitor user statistics but also to advertise us on the basis of the statistics.
                            The online advertising industry will struggle if AI is not implemented, as users
                            will be shown random advertisements that have no relation to their interests.
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai11.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>Since AI has been so good at determining our preferences and serving us ads, the
                            worldwide digital ad industry has crossed 250 billion US dollars, with the
                            business projected to cross the 300 billion mark in 2019. So, the next time
                            remembers that AI is changing your life while you browse the internet and
                            encounter adverts or product recommendations.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">12. Banking and Finance</h3>
                        <p>The banking and finance industry has a major impact on our daily lives which
                            means the world runs on liquidity, and banks are the gatekeepers who control the
                            flow. Did you know that artificial intelligence is heavily used in the banking
                            and finance industry for things such as customer service, investment, fraud
                            protection, and so on? The automatic emails we get from banks if we make an
                            ordinary transaction, are a simple example. That's AI keeping an eye on our
                            account and trying to alert us regarding any potential fraud. AI is now being
                            trained to examine vast samples of fraud data in order to identify patterns so
                            that we can be alerted before it happens to us. If we run into a snag and
                            contact our bank's customer service, we are probably speaking with an AI bot.
                            Even the largest financial industry use AI to analyse data in order to find the
                            best ways to invest capital in order to maximize returns while minimizing risk.
                        </p>

                        <p>Not only that, but AI is set to play an even larger role in the industry, with
                            major banks around the world investing billions of dollars in AI technology, and
                            we will be able to see the results sooner rather than later.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">13. Smart Home Devices</h3>
                        <p>Another popular example of AI (Artificial Intelligence) is smart home devices.
                            Artificial intelligence is even being welcomed into our homes. Most of the smart
                            home gadgets we purchase use artificial intelligence to learn our habits and
                            automatically change settings to make our experience as seamless as possible.
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/ai/images/examples-of-ai13.png"
                            alt="Examples of AI" />
                        <p>We have effectively examined how we utilize savvy voice assistants to control
                            these smart home gadgets. We probably are aware that it is a great example of
                            AI's impact on our lives. That is to say, there are smart thermostats that
                            change the temperature-dependent on our preferences, smart lights which change
                            the colour and intensity of lights dependent on time, and much more. This will
                            not happen when our primary interaction with all our smart home devices is only
                            through AI.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">14. curity and Surveillance</h3>
                        <p>Although we all can debate about the ethics of using a large surveillance system,
                            there's no denying that it's being used, and AI is playing a significant role in
                            it. It isn't workable for people to keep monitoring many monitors
                            simultaneously, and thus, utilizing AI makes well. With technologies such as
                            <strong>facial recognition</strong> and <strong>object recognition</strong>
                            improving every day, it won't be long when all the security camera deals with
                            are being checked by an AI and not a human. Right now, before AI can be
                            completely implemented, this is going to be our future.

                            time is awful. For instance, I enjoy Spotify's Discover Weekly playlist since it
                            has acquainted me with a few new artists who I would not have known about if it
                            weren't for Spotify's AI divine beings.</p>

                            uncountable hours simply watching the suggested videos. That suggested videos
                            section has become so great at knowing my taste that it's alarming. Thus, keep
                            in mind that AI is at work whenever you are watching a suggested video on
                            YouTube, viewing a suggested show on Netflix, listening to a pre-made playlist
                            on Spotify, or using any other media and music streaming service.</p>
