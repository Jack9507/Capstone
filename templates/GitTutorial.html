                        <p><strong>Git tutorial</strong> provides basic and advanced concepts of Git and
                            GitHub. Our Git tutorial is designed for beginners and professionals.</p>
                        <p>Git is a modern and widely used <strong>distributed version control</strong>
                            system in the world. It is developed to manage projects with high speed and
                            efficiency. The version control system allows us to monitor and work together
                            with our team members at the same workspace.</p>
                        <p>This tutorial will help you to understand the distributed version control system
                            Git via the command line as well as with <a
                                href="https://www.javatpoint.com/what-is-github">GitHub</a>. The examples in
                            this tutorial are performed on <strong>Windows</strong>, but we can also perform
                            same operations on other operating systems like <strong>Linux (Ubuntu)</strong>
                            and <strong>MacOS</strong>.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">What is Git?</h2>
                        <p><strong>Git</strong> is an <strong>open-source distributed version control
                                system</strong>. It is designed to handle minor to major projects with high
                            speed and efficiency. It is developed to co-ordinate the work among the
                            developers. The version control allows us to track and work together with our
                            team members at the same workspace.</p>
                        <p>Git is foundation of many services like <strong>GitHub</strong> and
                            <strong>GitLab</strong>, but we can use Git without using any other Git
                            services. Git can be used <strong>privately</strong> and
                            <strong>publicly</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <p>Git was created by <strong>Linus Torvalds</strong> in <strong>2005</strong> to
                            develop Linux Kernel. It is also used as an important distributed
                            version-control tool for <strong>the DevOps</strong>.</p>
                        <p>Git is easy to learn, and has fast performance. It is superior to other SCM tools
                            like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Features of Git</h2>
                        <p>Some remarkable features of Git are as follows:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/features-of-git.jpg"
                            alt="Features of Git" />
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Open Source</strong><br>
                                Git is an <strong>open-source tool</strong>. It is released under the
                                <strong>GPL</strong> (General Public License) license.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Scalable</strong><br>
                                Git is <strong>scalable</strong>, which means when the number of users
                                increases, the Git can easily handle such situations.</li>
                            <li><strong>Distributed</strong><br>
                                One of Git's great features is that it is <strong>distributed</strong>.
                                Distributed means that instead of switching the project to another machine,
                                we can create a "clone" of the entire repository. Also, instead of just
                                having one central repository that you send changes to, every user has their
                                own repository that contains the entire commit history of the project. We do
                                not need to connect to the remote repository; the change is just stored on
                                our local repository. If necessary, we can push these changes to a remote
                                repository. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/features-of-git2.png"
                            alt="Features of Git" />
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Security</strong><br>
                                Git is secure. It uses the <strong>SHA1 (Secure Hash Function)</strong> to
                                name and identify objects within its repository. Files and commits are
                                checked and retrieved by its checksum at the time of checkout. It stores its
                                history in such a way that the ID of particular commits depends upon the
                                complete development history leading up to that commit. Once it is
                                published, one cannot make changes to its old version.</li>
                            <li><strong>Speed</strong><br>
                                Git is very <strong>fast</strong>, so it can complete all the tasks in a
                                while. Most of the git operations are done on the local repository, so it
                                provides a <strong>huge speed</strong>. Also, a centralized version control
                                system continually communicates with a server somewhere. <br>
                                Performance tests conducted by Mozilla showed that it was <strong>extremely
                                    fast compared to other VCSs</strong>. Fetching version history from a
                                locally stored repository is much faster than fetching it from the remote
                                server. The <strong>core part of Git </strong>is <strong>written in
                                    C</strong>, which <strong>ignores</strong> runtime overheads associated
                                with other high-level languages.<br>
                                Git was developed to work on the Linux kernel; therefore, it is
                                <strong>capable</strong> enough to <strong>handle large</strong>
                                <strong>repositories</strong> effectively. From the beginning,
                                <strong>speed</strong> and <strong>performance</strong> have been Git's
                                primary goals.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Supports non-linear development</strong><br>
                                Git supports <strong>seamless branching and merging</strong>, which helps in
                                visualizing and navigating a non-linear development. A branch in Git
                                represents a single commit. We can construct the full branch structure with
                                the help of its parental commit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Branching and Merging</strong><br>
                                <strong>Branching and merging</strong> are the <strong>great
                                    feature</strong>s of Git, which makes it different from the other SCM
                                tools. Git allows the <strong>creation of multiple branches</strong> without
                                affecting each other. We can perform tasks like <strong>creation</strong>,
                                <strong>deletion</strong>, and <strong>merging</strong> on branches, and
                                these tasks take a few seconds only. Below are some features that can be
                                achieved by branching:
                                <ul class="points">
                                    <li>We can <strong>create a separate branch</strong> for a new module of
                                        the project, commit and delete it whenever we want.</li>
                                    <li>We can have a <strong>production branch</strong>, which always has
                                        what goes into production and can be merged for testing in the test
                                        branch.</li>
                                    <li>We can create a <strong>demo branch</strong> for the experiment and
                                        check if it is working. We can also remove it if needed.</li>
                                    <li>The core benefit of branching is if we want to push something to a
                                        remote repository, we do not have to push all of our branches. We
                                        can select a few of our branches, or all of them together.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Data Assurance</strong><br>
                                The Git data model ensures the <strong>cryptographic integrity</strong> of
                                every unit of our project. It provides a <strong>unique commit ID</strong>
                                to every commit through a <strong>SHA algorithm</strong>. We can
                                <strong>retrieve</strong> and <strong>update</strong> the commit by commit
                                ID. Most of the centralized version control systems do not provide such
                                integrity by default.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Staging Area</strong><br>
                                The <strong>Staging area</strong> is also a <strong>unique
                                    functionality</strong> of Git. It can be considered as a <strong>preview
                                    of our next commit</strong>, moreover, an <strong>intermediate
                                    area</strong> where commits can be formatted and reviewed before
                                completion. When you make a commit, Git takes changes that are in the
                                staging area and make them as a new commit. We are allowed to add and remove
                                changes from the staging area. The staging area can be considered as a place
                                where Git stores the changes.<br>
                                Although, Git doesn't have a dedicated staging directory where it can store
                                some objects representing file changes (blobs). Instead of this, it uses a
                                file called index.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <ul class="points">
                            Another feature of Git that makes it apart from other SCM tools is that
                            <strong>it is possible to quickly stage some of our files and commit them
                                without committing other modified files in our working directory.</strong>
                            <li><strong>Maintain the clean history</strong><br>
                                Git facilitates with Git Rebase; It is one of the most helpful features of
                                Git. It fetches the latest commits from the master branch and puts our code
                                on top of that. Thus, it maintains a clean history of the project.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Benefits of Git</h2>
                        <p>A version control application allows us to <strong>keep track</strong> of all the
                            changes that we make in the files of our project. Every time we make changes in
                            files of an existing project, we can push those changes to a repository. Other
                            developers are allowed to pull your changes from the repository and continue to
                            work with the updates that you added to the project files.</p>
                        <p>Some <strong>significant benefits</strong> of using Git are as follows:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/git-benefits.png"
                            alt="Benefits of Git" />
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Saves Time</strong><br>
                                Git is lightning fast technology. Each command takes only a few seconds to
                                execute so we can save a lot of time as compared to login to a GitHub
                                account and find out its features.</li>
                            <li><strong>Offline Working</strong><br>
                                One of the most important benefits of Git is that it supports
                                <strong>offline working</strong>. If we are facing internet connectivity
                                issues, it will not affect our work. In Git, we can do almost everything
                                locally. Comparatively, other CVS like SVN is limited and prefer the
                                connection with the central repository.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Undo Mistakes</strong><br>
                                One additional benefit of Git is we can <strong>Undo</strong> mistakes.
                                Sometimes the undo can be a savior option for us. Git provides the undo
                                option for almost everything.</li>
                            <li><strong>Track the Changes</strong><br>
                                Git facilitates with some exciting features such as <strong>Diff,
                                    Log,</strong> and <strong>Status</strong>, which allows us to track
                                changes so we can <strong>check the status, compare</strong> our files or
                                branches.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2 class="h2">Why Git?</h2>
                        <p>We have discussed many <strong>features</strong> and <strong>benefits</strong> of
                            Git that demonstrate the undoubtedly Git as the <strong>leading version control
                                system</strong>. Now, we will discuss some other points about why should we
                            choose Git.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/git/images/why-git.png" alt="Why Git" />
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Git Integrity</strong><br>
                                Git is <strong>developed to ensure</strong> the <strong>security</strong>
                                and <strong>integrity</strong> of content being version controlled. It uses
                                checksum during transit or tampering with the file system to confirm that

                        <p>A version control system is a software that tracks changes to a file or set of
                            files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It also allows
                            you to work together with other programmers.</p>
                        <p>The version control system is a collection of software tools that help a team to
                            manage changes in a source code. It uses a special kind of database to keep
                            track of every modification to the code.</p>
                        <p>Developers can compare earlier versions of the code with an older version to fix

                        <p>The Version Control System is very helpful and beneficial in software
                            development; developing software without using version control is unsafe. It
                            provides backups for uncertainty. Version control systems offer a speedy
                            interface to developers. It also allows software teams to preserve efficiency
                            and agility according to the team scales to include more developers.</p>
                        <p>Some key benefits of having a version control system are as follows.</p>

                            <li>Centralized version control systems</li>

                        </ul>

                            alt="Git Version Control system" />
                        <p>The localized version control method is a common approach because of its
                            simplicity. But this approach leads to a higher chance of error. In this
                            approach, you may forget which directory you're in and accidentally write to the
                            wrong file or copy over files you don't want to.</p>
                        <p>To deal with this issue, programmers developed local VCSs that had a simple
                            database. Such databases kept all the changes to files under revision control. A
                            local version control system keeps local copies of the files.</p>
                        <p>The major drawback of Local VCS is that it has a single point of failure.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Centralized Version Control System</h3>
                        <p>The developers needed to collaborate with other developers on other systems. The
                            localized version control system failed in this case. To deal with this problem,
                            Centralized Version Control Systems were developed. </p>

                            alt="Git Version Control system" />
                        <p>These systems have a single server that contains the versioned files, and some
                            clients to check out files from a central place. </p>
                        <p>Centralized version control systems have many benefits, especially over local
                            VCSs.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>Everyone on the system has information about the work what others are doing
                                on the project.</li>
                            <li>Administrators have control over other developers.</li>
                            <li>It is easier to deal with a centralized version control system than a
                                localized version control system.</li>
                            <li>A local version control system facilitates with a server software component
                                which stores and manages the different versions of the files. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>It also has the same drawback as in local version control system that it also has
                            a single point of failure.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Distributed Version Control System</h3>
                        <p>Centralized Version Control System uses a central server to store all the
                            database and team collaboration. But due to single point failure, which means
                            the failure of the central server, developers do not prefer it. Next, the
                            Distributed Version Control System is developed.</p>
                        <p>In a Distributed Version Control System (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or
                            Darcs), the user has a local copy of a repository. So, the clients don't just
                            check out the latest snapshot of the files even they can fully mirror the
                            repository. The local repository contains all the files and metadata present in
                            the main repository.</p>

                        <p>DVCS allows automatic management branching and merging. It speeds up of most
                            operations except pushing and pulling. DVCS enhances the ability to work offline
                            and does not rely on a single location for backups. If any server stops and
                            other systems were collaborating via it, then any of the client repositories
                            could be restored by that server. Every checkout is a full backup of all the
                            data.</p>
                        <p>These systems do not necessarily depend on a central server to store all the
                            versions of a project file.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Difference between Centralized Version Control System and Distributed
                            Version Control System</h2>
                        <!--<h3 class="h3">Centralized vs Distributed Version Control System</h3>-->
                        <p>Centralized Version Control Systems are systems that use
                            <strong>client/server</strong> architecture. In a centralized Version Control
                            System, one or more client systems are directly connected to a central server.
                            Contrarily the Distributed Version Control Systems are systems that use
                            <strong>peer-to-peer</strong> architecture.
                        </p>
                        <p>There are many benefits and drawbacks of using both the version control systems.
                            Let's have a look at some significant differences between Centralized and
                            Distributed version control system.</p>
