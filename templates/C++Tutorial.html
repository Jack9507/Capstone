                        <h2 class="h2"> What is C++</h2>
                        <p>C++ is a general purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports
                            object-oriented, procedural and generic programming.</p>
                        <p>C++ is a middle-level language, as it encapsulates both high and low level language features.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="h2">Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)</h2>
                        <p>C++ supports the object-oriented programming, the four major pillar of object-oriented
                            programming (<a href="cpp-oops-concepts">OOPs</a>) used in C++ are:</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">C++ Standard Libraries</h2>
                        <p>Standard C++ programming is divided into three important parts:</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>The core library includes the data types, variables and literals, etc.</li>
                            <li>The standard library includes the set of functions manipulating strings, files, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>The Standard Template Library (STL) includes the set of methods manipulating a data
                                structure.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>By the help of C++ programming language, we can develop different types of secured and robust
                            applications:</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>Window application</li>

                        <h2 class="h2">What is C?</h2>
                        <p>C is a structural or procedural oriented programming language which is
                            machine-independent and extensively used in various applications. </p>
                        <p>C is the basic programming language that can be used to develop from the
                            operating systems (like Windows) to complex programs like Oracle database, Git,
                            Python interpreter, and many more. C programming language can be called a god's
                            programming language as it forms the base for other programming languages. If we
                            know the C language, then we can easily learn other programming languages. C
                            language was developed by the great computer scientist Dennis Ritchie at the
                            Bell Laboratories. It contains some additional features that make it unique from
                            other programming languages. </p>
                        <h2 class="h2">What is C++?</h2>
                        <p>C++ is a special-purpose programming language developed by <strong>Bjarne
                                Stroustrup</strong> at Bell Labs circa 1980. C++ language is very similar to
                            C language, and it is so compatible with C that it can run 99% of C programs
                            without changing any source of code though C++ is an object-oriented programming
                            language, so it is safer and well-structured programming language than C.</p>
                        <p class="pq"><strong>Let's understand the differences between C and C++.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/cpages/images/c-vs-cpp.png" alt="C vs C++" />
                        <p><strong>The following are the differences between C and C++:</strong></p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>Definition</strong><br>
                                C is a structural programming language, and it does not support classes and
                                objects, while C++ is an object-oriented programming language that supports
                                the concept of classes and objects.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type of programming language</strong><br>
                                C supports the structural programming language where the code is checked
                                line by line, while C++ is an object-oriented programming language that
                                supports the concept of classes and objects.</li>
                            <li><strong>Developer of the language</strong><br>
                                Dennis Ritchie developed C language at Bell Laboratories while Bjarne
                                Stroustrup developed the C++ language at Bell Labs circa 1980.</li>
                            <li><strong>Subset</strong><br>
                                C++ is a superset of C programming language. C++ can run 99% of C code but C
                                language cannot run C++ code.</li>
                            <li><strong>Type of approach</strong><br>
                                C follows the top-down approach, while C++ follows the bottom-up approach.
                                The top-down approach breaks the main modules into tasks; these tasks are
                                broken into sub-tasks, and so on. The bottom-down approach develops the
                                lower level modules first and then the next level modules.</li>
                            <li><strong>Security</strong><br>
                                In C, the data can be easily manipulated by the outsiders as it does not
                                support the encapsulation and information hiding while C++ is a very secure
                                language, i.e., no outsiders can manipulate its data as it supports both
                                encapsulation and data hiding. In C language, functions and data are the
                                free entities, and in C++ language, all the functions and data are
                                encapsulated in the form of objects.</li>
                            <li><strong>Function Overloading</strong><br>
                                Function overloading is a feature that allows you to have more than one
                                function with the same name but varies in the parameters. C does not support
                                the function overloading, while C++ supports the function overloading.</li>
                            <li><strong>Function Overriding</strong><br>
                                Function overriding is a feature that provides the specific implementation
                                to the function, which is already defined in the base class. C does not
                                support the function overriding, while C++ supports the function overriding.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Reference variables</strong><br>
                                C does not support the reference variables, while C++ supports the reference
                                variables.</li>
                            <li><strong>Keywords</strong><br>
                                C contains 32 keywords, and C++ supports 52 keywords.</li>
                            <li><strong>Namespace feature</strong><br>
                                A namespace is a feature that groups the entities like classes, objects, and
                                functions under some specific name. C does not contain the namespace
                                feature, while C++ supports the namespace feature that avoids the name
                                collisions.</li>
                            <li><strong>Exception handling</strong><br>
                                C does not provide direct support to the exception handling; it needs to use
                                functions that support exception handling. C++ provides direct support to
                                exception handling by using a try-catch block.</li>
                            <li><strong>Input/Output functions</strong><br>
                                In C, scanf and printf functions are used for input and output operations,
                                respectively, while in C++, cin and cout are used for input and output
                                operations, respectively.</li>
                            <li><strong>Memory allocation and de-allocation</strong><br>
                                C supports calloc() and malloc() functions for the memory allocation, and
                                free() function for the memory de-allocation. C++ supports a new operator
                                for the memory allocation and delete operator for the memory de-allocation.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Inheritance</strong><br>
                                Inheritance is a feature that allows the child class to reuse the properties
                                of the parent class. C language does not support the inheritance while C++
                                supports the inheritance.</li>
                            <li><strong>Header file</strong><br>
                                C program uses <strong>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</strong> header file while C++
                                program uses <strong>&lt;iostream.h&gt;</strong> header file.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Let's summarize the above differences in a tabular form.</strong></p>

                        <h3 class="h3">1) Simple</h3>
                        <p>C++ is a simple language in the sense that it provides structured approach (to
                            break the problem into parts), rich set of library functions, data types etc.
                        </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">2) Machine Independent or Portable</h3>
                        <p>Unlike assembly language, c programs can be executed in many machines with little
                            bit or no change. But it is not platform-independent.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">3) Mid-level programming language</h3>
                        <p>C++ is also used to do low level programming. It is used to develop system
                            applications such as kernel, driver etc. It also supports the feature of high
                            level language. That is why it is known as mid-level language.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">4) Structured programming language</h3>
                        <p>C++ is a structured programming language in the sense that we can break the
                            program into parts using functions. So, it is easy to understand and modify.</p>

                        <h3 class="h3">5) Rich Library</h3>
                        <p>C++ provides a lot of inbuilt functions that makes the development fast.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">6) Memory Management</h3>
                        <p>It supports the feature of dynamic memory allocation. In C++ language, we can
                            free the allocated memory at any time by calling the free() function.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">7) Speed</h3>
                        <p>The compilation and execution time of C++ language is fast.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">8) Pointer</h3>
                        <p>C++ provides the feature of pointers. We can directly interact with the memory by
                            using the pointers. We can use pointers for memory, structures, functions, array
                            etc.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">9) Recursion</h3>
                        <p>In C++, we can call the function within the function. It provides code
                            reusability for every function.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">10) Extensible</h3>
                        <p>C++ language is extensible because it can easily adopt new features.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">11) Object Oriented</h3>
                        <p>C++ is object oriented programming language. OOPs makes development and
                            maintenance easier where as in Procedure-oriented programming language it is not
                            easy to manage if code grows as project size grows.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">12) Compiler based</h3>
                        <p>C++ is a compiler based programming language, it means without compilation no C++
                            program can be executed. First we need to compile our program using compiler and
                            then we can execute our program.</p>

                        <p>A variable is a name of memory location. It is used to store data. Its value can
                            be changed and it can be reused many times.</p>
                        <p>It is a way to represent memory location through symbol so that it can be easily
                            identified.</p>
                        <p>Let's see the syntax to declare a variable:</p>

    type variable_list; 
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>The example of declaring variable is given below:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">
    int x;  
    float y;  
    char z;  
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Here, x, y, z are variables and int, float, char are data types.</p>
                        <p>We can also provide values while declaring the variables as given below:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">
    int x=5,b=10;  //declaring 2 variable of integer type  
    float f=30.8;  
    char c='A';  
    </textarea></div>

                        <h2 class="h2">Rules for defining variables</h2>
                        <p>A variable can have alphabets, digits and underscore.</p>
                        <p>A variable name can start with alphabet and underscore only. It can't start with
                            digit.</p>
                        <p>No white space is allowed within variable name.</p>
                        <p>A variable name must not be any reserved word or keyword e.g. char, float etc.
                        </p>
                        <p>Valid variable names:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="cpp">
    int a;  
    int _ab;  
    int a30;  
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Invalid variable names:</p>
