                        <p>Bash Scripting Tutorial provides core and advanced concepts of Bash Shell
                            scripting. Our Bash tutorial is designed for beginners and working
                            professionals.</p>
                        <p>Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a shell program. It was written by Brian Fox as an
                            enhanced version of the Bourne Shell program 'sh'. It is an open source GNU
                            project. It provides functional improvements over Bourne Shell for both
                            programming and interactive use.</p>
                        <p>Our Bash Shell tutorial includes all the Bash topics such as Bash Scripting,
                            variables, loops, conditional statements, positional parameters, arithmetics,
                            functions, strings, etc.</p>
    
                        <h2 class="h2">Prerequisite</h2>
                        <p>Before learning Bash Shell, you must have the basic knowledge of the Linux
                            Operating System and any programming language.</p>

                        <ol class="points">
                            <li>Bash is <strong>sh-compatible</strong> as it derived from the original UNIX
                                Bourne Shell. It is incorporated with the best and useful features of the
                                Korn and C shell like directory manipulation, job control, aliases, etc.
                            </li>
                            <li>Bash can be <strong>invoked by</strong> single-character command line
                                options (<strong>-a, -b, -c, -i, -l, -r, etc. </strong>) as well as by
                                multi-character command line options also like --debugger, --help, --login,
                                etc.</li>
                            <li>Bash <strong>Start-up files</strong> are the scripts that Bash reads and
                                executes when it starts. Each file has its specific use, and the collection
                                of these files is used to help create an environment.</li>
                            <li>Bash consists of <strong>Key bindings</strong> by which one can set up
                                customized editing key sequences.</li>
                            <li>Bash contains <strong>one-dimensional arrays</strong> using which you can
                                easily reference and manipulate the lists of data.</li>
                            <li>Bash comprised of <strong>Control Structures</strong> like the
                                <strong>select construct</strong> that specially used for menu generation.
                            </li>
                            <li>Directory Stack in Bash specifies the history of recently-visited
                                directories within a list. Example: <strong>pushd</strong> builtin is used
                                to add the directory to the stack, <strong>popd</strong> is to remove
                                directory from the stack and <strong>dirs</strong> builtin is to display
                                content of the directory stack.</li>
                            <li>Bash also comprised of restricted mode for the environment security. A shell
                                gets restricted if bash starts with name <strong>rbash</strong>, or the bash
                                --restricted, or bash -r option passed at invocation. </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>As per the discussion in previous topics, let's move to create a first and basic
                            Bash Script by using the given steps: </p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Open the terminal. Navigate the desktop folder or
                            directory using the cd command.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Create an empty file as a shell script using touch
                            command and name it as bash_script.sh to execute. In the below image, you can
                            see the created file with all the permission attributes in the darkened row.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/hello-world-bash-script.png"
                            alt="Hello World! Bash Script" />
                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Open the file using any editor or visual studio. For
                            using editor gedit, type</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    gedit bash_script.sh/ 
    </textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Now Code for the intended script, i.e., Hello World! </p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    #! /bin/bash
    
    # This is the basic bash script
    
    echo " Hello World! "
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Where, Line 1 represents #! (shebang) and specifies the bash shell location.</p>
                        <p>Line 2 represents the commented line.</p>
                        <p>Line 3 represents echo command to print the output.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong>Execute the Script prefixing with ./. </p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/hello-world-bash-script2.png"
                            alt="Hello World! Bash Script" />
                        <p>It will throw the Permission denied error. Because the file has only read and
                            write permissions but not execute permission, you can see it below:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/hello-world-bash-script3.png"

                        <p>So we add the execute permission to the file using <strong>chmod</strong>command
                            with <strong>+x</strong> option as</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    chmod +x bash_script.sh 
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>and finally, execute the script.</p>

                        <p>Variables are the essential part of programming, or we can say that they are the
                            spirit of a programming language. Variables specify the memory location through
                            characters, numeric, and alphanumeric. They are used to be referenced and
                            manipulated in a computer program.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">What are the variables?</h2>
                        <p>Variables are the containers which store data or a useful piece of information as
                            the value inside them. Below is the syntax for a variable:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    Variable_name =value 
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>A Variable is a combined form of two words, i.e., vary + able, which means its
                            value can be changed, and it can be used for multiple times.</p>
                        <p>Variable is known as the temporary storage for any kind of data like integer,
                            float, char, etc. A variable name can include <strong>alphabets, digits, and
                                underscore</strong>, and its name can be started with alphabets and
                            underscore only. </p>
                        <h4 class="n">Note: We cannot define a variable name starting with any digit. </h4>
                        <h2 class="h2">What are Bash Variables?</h2>
                        <p>We cannot use bash variables without having the proper information
                            (<strong>syntax, data types, types, working</strong>) about it, so, let's go
                            throughout this brief tutorial for having the appropriate overview of Bash
                            Variables. </p>
                        <p>At first, know the syntax.</p>

    Variable_name=value
    </textarea></div>
                        <h2 class="h3">Rules Set for Defining Bash Variables:</h2>
                        <ol class="points">
                            <li>Prefix the variable name with dollar ($) sign while reading or printing a
                                variable.</li>
                            <li>Leave off the dollar sign ($) while setting a variable with any value.</li>
                            <li>A variable name may be alphanumeric, or it may be written with an underscore
                                (_).</li>
                            <li>A variable name is case-sensitive: x and X are considered as two different
                                variables.</li>
                            <li> variable name can be written either in UPPER_CASE or LOWER_CASE letters or
                                mixture of both as you want.</li>
                            <li>A variable can be placed at anywhere in a Bash Script or on the command
                                line, because on runtime, Bash will replace it with its assigned value. It
                                became possible because of doing substitution before running the command.
                            </li>
                            <li>There should not be whitespace on either side of the equal sign (=) between
                                the variable name and its value. Following are some example of
                                <strong>Invalid Variables</strong> having whitespaces (denoted by dots ...)
                                between them as given below:<br>
                                var1=...variable1<br>
                                var2...=variable2<br>
                                var3...=...variable3
                            </li>
                            <li>There is no need of using any quotes, either single or double, to define a
                                variable with single character value such as <strong>var1=variable</strong>.
                                To input multiple words or String as a single item in a variable, then make
                                use of quotes for enclosing your content in that variable.
                                <ul class="points">
                                    <li>Single Quote ('') helps to treat every character.</li>
                                    <li>Double Quote ("") helps to do the substitution.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
    
                        <h2 class="h2">Data Types</h2>
                        <p>In the formal programming languages, you have to define the data type of any
                            variable at the time of variable declaration. For example:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    int year=2012
    char comp_name='jtp'
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>But in case of Bash, you don't have to define the data type of any variable at
                            the time of variable declaration. Bash variables are <strong>untyped</strong>,
                            which means just type the variable name by assigning its value, and it will
                            automatically consider that data type. </p>
                        <p>Such that if you assign any numeric value to the variable, it will work as
                            integer and if you assign a character value to the variable, then it will be
                            String.</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    year=2012
    comp_name=jtp
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>using echo command, read them by assigning $ sign before their name such as </p>
                        <p>echo $year<br>
                            echo $name </p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Types of Bash Variables</h2>
                        <p>There are two types of variables in a shell or any UNIX system.</p>
                        <ol class="points">
                            <li>System-Defined Variables</li>
                            <li>User-Defined Variables</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>1. System-Defined Variables:</strong> These are the pre-defined variables
                            as they are created and maintained by the LINUX operating system itself. Their
                            standard convention is that generally they are defined in capital letters, i.e.,
                            UPPER_CASE. So whenever you see a variable defined in upper cases, most likely,
                            they are the system-defined variables. </p>

                        <p>Let's call these variables through Bash Shell. Following are the given steps:</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a script named by Bash_sdvar and type the
                            following code on the Bash Console as follows: </p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    #! /bin/bash
    # Bash System-defined Variables
    echo $HOME # Home Directory
    echo $PWD # current working directory
    echo $BASH # Bash shell name
    echo $BASH_VERSION # Bash shell Version
    echo $LOGNAME # Name of the Login User
    echo $OSTYPE # Type of OS
    </textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> Look at the Bash Console given below:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/bash-variable3.png"
                            alt="Bash Variables" />
                        <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Save and execute the script. It will show the output as
                            you can see in the figure given below.</p>
                        <p><strong>Output:</strong></p>

                        <p><strong>2. User-defined Variables:</strong> These variables are created and
                            maintained by the user. Generally, these types of variables are defined in
                            LOWER_CASES. There is not any strict rule to write these variables in
                            lower-cases. We can write them in upper-cases also.</p>
                        <p>Let's create a Bash Script to define these variables. Follow the given steps
                            given below: </p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Create a script named by <strong>Bash_udvar</strong> and
                            type the following code on Bash Console:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    #! /bin/bash
    # User-Defined Variables 
    name=Peter
    ROLL_NO=5245325
    echo "The student name is $name and his Roll number is $ROLL_NO."
    </textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Step 2.</strong> See the code on Bash Console.</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">Working of Bash Variables</h2>
                        <p>After having a basic demonstration of variables, let's move to know how do they
                            work? </p>
                        <p>There are two actions we usually perform for a variable in Bash as given below:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><em><strong>setting a value</strong></em> for a Variable</li>
                            <li><em><strong>reading the value</strong></em> for it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>A variable value can be set in different ways in which the most common way is to
                            set the value directly. To read a variable, we can place its name (prefixing
                            with $ sign) anywhere in the script. </p>
                        <p>Bash first checks all the variable names as if they are present in the script.
                            Then it interprets every line of our script. After identifying every variable,
                            it replaces a variable name with its assigned value. After all, it
                            interprets/runs that line of code and continues this process for every coded
                            line of our script.</p>
                        <h4 class="n">NOTE: Both the kinds of variables in Bash (we discussed) work on the
                            terminal as well as on Bash script. Let see their working on terminal and Bash
                            through a straightforward example:</h4>
                        <p><strong><em>Example:</em></strong> Call a user name by XYZ, his location at which
                            he is currently working, and the version of Bash Shell he is using for Bash
                            Scripting. </p>
                        <h3 class="h3">1. Working On Terminal</h3>

                        <h3 class="h3">2. Working on Bash Shell</h3>
                        <p>See the script named by Bash_Var given below:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/bash-variable8.png"
                            alt="Bash Variables" />
                        <p><strong>In the 3<sup>rd</sup> line of the script</strong>, we declared a variable
                            <strong>USER_NAME</strong> to store the user name <strong>XYZ</strong> as its
                            value.
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>In the last two lines</strong>, we have printed the intended message by
                            using the <strong>echo</strong> command.</p>
                        <p>There are two variables and one command in this message. Each one of them is
                            preceded by the dollar ($) sign where:</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>USER_NAME</strong> is a user-defined variable to call the user name,
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>BASH_VERSION</strong> is system-defined variable, which shell calls
                                itself. It is used to print the version of Bash Shell, </li>
                            <li><strong>PWD</strong> command is used to print the current location of the
                                user.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>For better understanding, create this script by following the given code:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    #! /bin/bash
    #Bash Variables
    USER_NAME=XYZ
    echo Hey there! $USER_NAME is any user currently working on the directory $PWD with Bash Shell Version $BASH_VERSION.
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>It will show the output as you can see in the following image:</p>

                        <p>Command Line Arguments are used to make a script more dynamic by passing input to
                            the code. We pass these arguments at the runtime of the script as the following
                            form:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    ./script_name arg1 arg2 arg3.....

                        <p>There should be no space between the script name and all the passing arguments.

                        <p>In a Bash Shell, they are used with the reference of the following
                            default-parameters or the special variables.</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li><strong>$0</strong> specifies the name of the script to be invoked.</li>
                            <li><strong>$1-$9</strong> stores the names of the first 9 arguments or can be
                                used as the arguments' positions.</li>
                            <li><strong>$#</strong> specifies the total number (count) of arguments passed
                                to the script.</li>
                            <li><strong>$*</strong> stores all the command line arguments by joining them
                                together.</li>
                            <li><strong>$@</strong> stores the list of arguments as an array.</li>
                            <li><strong>$?</strong> specifies the process ID of the current script.</li>
                            <li><strong>$$</strong> specifies the exit status of the last command or the
                                most recent execution process.</li>
                            <li><strong>$!</strong> shows ID of the last background job.</li>

                        <p>It is the second way of passing the arguments as an Array. Follow the given
                            algorithm to apply this method.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Create a Bash Script. </p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Declare any variable name and assign its value as
                            <strong>$a</strong> in the following form:
                        </p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    variable_name=("$@")
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Where <strong>$@</strong> is the default argument which is used to store the
                            arguments (we pass) as an array.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Display the arguments by defining their array index in
                            the following form:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    ${variable_name[i]}
    </textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Save and close the Script.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Execute the Script by passing the arguments.</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">Command Substitution</h2>
                        <p>According to the Bash Official Documentation</p>
                        <p><em>"Command Substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command
                                itself. Bash performs the expansion by executing the command in a subshell
                                environment and replacing the command substitution with the standard output
                                of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Embedded newlines are
                                not deleted, but they may be removed during word splitting."</em></p>
                        <p>Command substitution refers to an expansion which Bash performs for us. It takes
                            the output of the Bash command, stores in a variable (generally), and display
                            back with echo.</p>
                        <p><strong>Command Substitution</strong> offers data flexibility in regards to
                            scripting and variable assignment. It is simple and easy for having the single
                            command line output. In case, the output goes over a few lines, then the newly
                            trailing lines are removed, and the full content of output ends up on a single
                            line.</p>
                        <p>See the syntax for use:</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The classic form of substituting commands in a variable or command substitution
                            is using backquotes (`...`), as given below: </p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    variable_name=`command_name`
    variable_name=`command_name [option...] argument1 argument2...`
    variable_name=`/path/to/command`
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Now, we do command substitution by enclosing the commands within brackets
                            (preceded by the dollar sign ($)). Have a look: </p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="java">
    variable_name=$(command_name)
    variable_name=$(command_name [option...] argument1 argument2...)
    variable_name=$(path/to/command)
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>So, let's do command substitution with an example as per the discussion. </p>
                        <p>In this example, we are substituting single command ls in a variable. See the
                            terminal.</p>

                        <p><strong>Line 1:</strong> Without command substitution, the output is expanded in
                            multiple lines.</p>
                        <p><strong>Line 2 and 3:</strong> With command substitution, the output is ended on
                            a single line (saved space by removing newly trailed lines).</p>
                        <p>Following is the Bash Script to test the command substitution. </p>

                        <p>In this topic, we will understand how to use arithmetic operators in Bash.</p>
                        <p>Depending on what type of result we want through our scripts, we may need to
                            apply arithmetic operators at some point. Like variables, they are reasonably
                            easy to apply. In the bash script, we can perform arithmetic operations on
                            numeric values to get the desired result.</p>
                        <p>There are 11 arithmetic operators which are supported by Bash Shell.</p>

                        <h3 class="h3">Backticks</h3>
                        <p>In bash scripting, an arithmetic expansion can also be performed using
                            <strong>backticks</strong> and expr (known as all-purpose expression evaluator).
                            The `expr` is similar to 'let,' but it does not save the result to a variable.
                            It directly prints the result. Unlike let, we don't need to enclose the
                            expression within the quotes. We are required to use spaces between the items of
                            the expression. It is important to note that we should use 'expr` within command
                            substitution to save the output to a variable.
                        </p>
                        <p>We can also use `expr` without 'backticks'.</p>

                        <p>In this topic, we have demonstrated about bash string and its operators.</p>
                        <p>Like other programming languages, Bash String is a data type such as as an
                            integer or floating-point unit. It is used to represent text rather than
                            numbers. It is a combination of a set of characters that may also contain
                            numbers.</p>
                        <p><strong>For example,</strong> the word "javatpoint" and the phrase "Welcome to
                            javatpoint" are the strings. Even "01234" could be considered as a string, if
                            specified correctly. Programmers are required to enclose strings in quotation
                            marks for the data to be considered as a string and not a number, variable name
                            or array, etc.</p>
                        <p>Bash consists of multiple ways to perform string operations and manipulate them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Following are some operators in Shell Script used to perform string operations:

                        <p>An equal operator (=) is used to check whether two strings are equal. </p>

                            readable and avoid writing the same code again and again. It also allows the
                            developers to break a complicated and lengthy code to small parts which can be
                            called whenever required. Functions can be called anytime and repeatedly, which
                            will enable us to reuse, optimize, and minimize the code.</p>
                        <p>Following are some key points about bash functions:</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>A function has to be declared in the shell script before we can use it.</li>
                            <li>Arguments can be passed to the functions and accessed inside the function as
                                $1, $2, etc.</li>
                            <li>Local variables can be assigned within the function, and the scope of such
                                variables will only be that particular function.</li>
                            <li>Built-in commands of Bash shell can be overridden using functions.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3 class="h3">Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The syntax for declaring a bash function can be defined in two formats:</p>
                        <p>1. The first method starts with the function name, followed by parentheses. It is
                            the most preferred and commonly used method:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    function_name () {
    commands
    }
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Single line version can be mentioned as below:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    function_name () { commands; }
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>2. The second method starts with the function reserved word, followed by the
                            function name:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    function function_name {
    commands
    }
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Single line version can be mentioned as below:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    function function_name { commands; }
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>Compared to most of the programming languages, Bash functions are somewhat
                            limited. Let?s understand the concept with the help of some examples:</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Example: Method 1</h3>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">

                        <h2 class="h2">Passing Arguments</h2>
                        <p>Like most of the programming languages, we can also pass the arguments and
                            process the data in bash functions. We can insert the data to the function in a
                            similar way as passing-command line arguments to a bash script.</p>
                        <p>To pass any number of arguments to the bash function, we are required to insert
                            them just after the function's name. We must apply spaces between function name
                            and arguments. It will also be a great choice to use double quotes around the
                            arguments to prevent misparsing of the arguments with spaces in it.</p>
                        <p>Following are some key points about passing arguments to the bash functions:</p>
                        <ul class="points">
                            <li>The given arguments are accessed as $1, $2, $3 ... $n, corresponding to the
                                position of the arguments after the function's name.</li>
                            <li>The $0 variable is kept reserved for the function's name.</li>
                            <li>The $# variable is used to hold the number of positional argument/ parameter
                                given to the function.</li>
                            <li>The $* and $@ variables are used to hold all the arguments/ parameters given
                                to the function.
                                <ul class="points">
                                    <li>When $* is used with double quotes (i.e., "$*" ), it expands to a
                                        single string separated by the space. For example, "$1 $2 $n etc".
                                    </li>
                                    <li>When $@ is used with double quotes (i.e., "$@" ), it expands to the
                                        separate string. For example, "$1" "$2" "$n" etc.</li>
                                    <li>When $* and $# are not used with the double quotes, they both are
                                        the same.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                        <p>In this script, we have added the values "We", "welcome", "you", "on" and
                            "Javatpoint" after we have called the function_arguments. Those values are
                            passed to the <strong>function_arguments</strong> as parameters and stored in a
                            local variable. However, unlike other languages, the interpreter stores the
                            passed values into predefined variables, which are then named according to the
                            sequence of passing parameters.</p>
                        <p><strong>For example,</strong></p>
                        <p><strong>"We"</strong> word is stored to the variable <strong>1</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>"welcome"</strong> word is stored to the variable
                            <strong>2</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>"you"</strong> word is stored to the variable <strong>3</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>"on"</strong> word is stored to the variable <strong>4</strong>.<br>
                            <strong>"Javatpoint"</strong> word is stored to the variable <strong>5</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Variable Scope</h2>
                        <p>Global variables are defined as the variables which can be accessed anywhere
                            within the script regardless of the scope. By default, all the variables are
                            defined as global variables, even if they are declared inside the function. We
                            can also create variables as a local variable. Local variables can be declared
                            within the function body with the ?local? keyword when they are assigned for
                            first time. They are only accessible inside that function. We can create local
                            variables with the same name in different functions. To add a local variable, we
                            can use the following syntax:</p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    local var_name=<var_value>
    </textarea></div>
                        <p>To better understand how variables scope works in Bash Scripting, check out the
                            following example:</p>
                        <p><strong>Bash Script</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    #!/bin/bash
    
    v1='A'
    v2='B'
    
    my_var () {
    local v1='C'
    v2='D'
    echo "Inside Function"
    echo "v1 is $v1."
    echo "v2 is $v2."
    }
    
    echo "Before Executing the Function"
    echo "v1 is $v1."
    echo "v2 is $v2."
    
    my_var
    echo "After Executing the Function"
    echo "v1 is $v1."
    echo "v2 is $v2."
    </textarea></div>

                            alt="Bash Functions" />
                        <p>As per output, if we set a local variable within the function body with the same
                            name as an existing global variable, then it will have precedence over the
                            global variable. Global variables can be modified within the function.</p>
                        <h2 class="h2">Return Values</h2>
                        <p>Most of the programming languages have the concept of returning a value for the
                            functions. It means that the function has to send the data back to the original
                            calling location. Unlike functions in 'real' programming languages, Bash
                            function doesn't provide support to return a value when it is called. However,
                            they allow us to set a return status which is similar to how a program or
                            command exits with an exit status. When a bash function completes, its return
                            value is the status of the last executed statement in the function. It returns 0
                            for the success status and non-zero decimal number in the 1-255 range for
                            failure.</p>
                        <p>The return status can be indicated by using the 'return' keyword, and it is
                            assigned to the variable $?. The return statement terminates the function and
                            works as the function's exit status.</p>
                        <p><strong>For example,</strong> consider the following code:</p>
                        <p><strong>Bash Script</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    #!/bin/bash
    #Setting up a return status for a function
    
    print_it () {
    	echo Hello $1
    	return 5
    }
    
    print_it User
    print_it Reader
    echo The previous function returned a value of $?
    </textarea></div>

                            alt="Bash Functions" />
                        <p>Another better option to return a value from a function is to send the value to
                            <strong>stdout</strong> using <strong>echo</strong> or <strong>printf</strong>
                            commands, as shown below:
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>Bash Script</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    #!/bin/bash
    
    print_it () {
    	local my_greet="Welcome to Javatpoint."
    	echo "$my_greet"
    }
    
    my_greet="$(print_it)"
    echo $my_greet
    </textarea></div>
                        <p><strong>Output</strong></p>
                        <div class="codeblock3">

                        </div>
                        <h2 class="h2">Overriding Commands</h2>
                        <p>We have an option to override the bash commands by creating a function with the
                            same name as the command that we are going to override. For example, if we want
                            to override the 'echo' command, then we have to create a function with the name
                            'echo'.</p>
                        <p>This concept of overriding the bash commands may be helpful in some scenarios
                            like when we want to use a command with specific options. Also, when we do not
                            like to provide the whole command with options for several times within the
                            script. In such cases, we can override the in-built bash command for command
                            with options. Now, let's understand the concept of overriding the commands in
                            Bash Shell Scripting with the help of some examples:</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Example</h3>
                        <p>In this example, we have overridden the 'echo' command and added the time stamp
                            in the form of the argument to the 'echo' command.</p>

                        <p>In this topic, we demonstrated about Bash Function. A Bash function is considered
                            as a block of reusable code developed to perform a specific operation. Once it
                            is defined, it can be called several times within a script.</p>

                        <p>On UNIX-like operating systems, a <strong>hash</strong> is a
                            <strong>built-in</strong> command of the bash shell, which is used to list a
                            hash table of recently executed commands. It is used for views, resets, or
                            manually changes within the bash path hash. It keeps the locations of recently
                            executed programs and shows them whenever we want to see it. It provides a
                            complete pathname of each command name.
                        </p>
                        <p>In other words, when any command is executed without naming its path, the shell
                            starts searching for that command within the directories, which are listed in
                            the path variable. When the Bash gets that command, it keeps the location in a
                            hash table so that it can remember the location of the command. After that, Bash
                            starts checking the table to find the location of the command instead of looking
                            for the command again. It makes the command run faster. However, if the command
                            is moved after recording its location in a table, the shell will not be able to
                            find the command. In this case, a full search of the directories in the path is
                            performed to get the command data.</p>
                        <p>The built-in 'hash' command is responsible for maintaining the hash table.
                            Without any switches, hash lists the previously used commands, their locations,
                            and the number of times they have been executed during the session.</p>
                        <h3 class="h3">Syntax</h3>
                        <div class="codeblock"><textarea name="code" class="xml">
    hash [-l] [-r] [-p pathname] [-d] [-t] [command_name . . .]

                        <p>The syntax above is used to determine and remember the full pathname of each
                            command_name. If there are no arguments, it displays the information about
                            previously used commands and their locations.</p>

                        We can display the hash table for the current session by invoking hash without any

                            the command with its path during the session. The sum of all the hits is

                        <p>If we use the <strong>-l option</strong>, then it will display a hash table in a
                            format that can be used as an input, i.e.,

                        <p>We can also print the remembered locations of commands which are used during the
                            session by using the <strong>-t</strong> option.</p>

                        <h2 class="h2">Adding a Command Path and Name to the Bash Hash Table</h2>
                        <p>We can add items to the hash table that can be used again in the shell. It should
                            be remembered that the hash table only exists in the current live session of the
                            shell. If we open a new shell, the bash will create a new hash table according
                            to the executed commands of that shell.</p>
                        <p>As soon as we start running the first command, bash starts creating a hash table.
                            To add a command to the hash table, we can use the -p option followed by the
                            path and then the name. In this way, we can use the hash table as similar to an
                            alias. Following is an example where we have added the
                            <strong>/home/bash.sh</strong> script to the hash table with the name
                            '<strong>bash</strong>'.
                        </p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/bash-hash-command6.png"
                            alt="Hash Command" />
                        <p>After adding the /home/bash.sh to the hash table with a mapped name 'bash', we
                            can directly invoke it by the name 'bash':</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/bash-hash-command7.png"
                            alt="Hash Command" />
                        <p>Bash checks the hash table for the command name to find the executable.
                            Generally, there is no need to put the script in the path unless we want it to
                            be available in a new shell.</p>
                        <h2 class="h3">Deleting an Item from the Hash Table</h2>
                        <p>We also have an option to delete or forget a remembered location of commands in
                            hash bash. We can simply use the <strong>-d</strong> option followed by the name
                            to perform this task:</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/bash-hash-command8.png"
                            alt="Hash Command" />
                        <p>Here, we have deleted the <strong>/home/bash.sh</strong> from the hash table,
                            which was mapped with a name '<strong>bash</strong>'.</p>
                        <h2 class="h3">Clearing the Hash Table</h2>
                        <p>To clear the hash table, we can use the <strong>-r</strong> option.</p>
                        <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/tutorial/bash/images/bash-hash-command9.png"
                            alt="Hash Command" />
                        <p>Here, it can be seen that the hash table is cleared successfully by using the -r
                            option.</p>
